<h2 class="intro">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="l15post" />

<p>Pictures of the Social Life of the Metropolis during
the last two centuries are by no means rare. We possess
them in Diaries, Memoirs, and Correspondence, in
almost countless volumes, that sparkle with humour
and gaiety, alternating with more serious phases,&mdash;political
or otherwise,&mdash;according to the colour and complexion,
and body of the time. Of such pictures the
most attractive are Clubs.</p>

<p>Few attempts have, however, been made to <i>focus</i> the
Club-life of periods, or to assemble with reasonable
limits, the histories of the leading Associations of clubbable
Men,&mdash;of Statesmen and Politicians, Wits and
Poets, Authors, Artists, and Actors, and "men of wit
and pleasure," which the town has presented since the
days of the Restoration; or in more direct succession,
from the reign of Queen Anne, and the days of the
<i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>, and other Essayists in their wake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">vi</a></span></p>

<p>The present Work aims to record this Club-life in
a series of sketches of the leading Societies, in which,
without assuming the gravity of history or biography,
sufficient attention is paid to both to give the several
narratives the value of trustworthiness. From the multitude
of Clubs it has been found expedient to make a
selection, in which the Author has been guided by the
popular interest attached to their several histories. The
same principle has been adopted in bringing the Work
up to our own time, in which the customary reticence
in such cases has been maintained.</p>

<p>Of interest akin to that of the Clubs have been considered
scenes of the Coffee-house and Tavern Life of the
period, which partake of a greater breadth of humour,
and are, therefore, proportionally attractive, for these
sections of the Work. The antiquarianism is sparse, or
briefly descriptive; the main object being personal characteristics,
the life and manners, the sayings and doings,
of classes among whom conviviality is often mixed up
with better qualities, and the finest humanities are
blended with the gladiatorship and playfulness of wit
and humour.</p>

<p>With a rich store of materials at his command, the
Author, or Compiler, has sought, by selection and condensation,
to avoid the long-windedness of story-telling;
for the anecdote should be, like the viand,&mdash;"'twere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span>
well if it were done quickly." Although the staple of
the book is compiled, the experience and information
which the Author has gathered by long familiarity with
the Metropolis have enabled him to annotate and illustrate
in his own progress, notwithstanding the "lion's
share" of the labour is duly awarded to others.</p>

<p>Thus, there are grouped in the present volume
sketches of One Hundred Clubs, ranging from the
Mermaid, in Bread-street, to the Garrick, in Covent
Garden. Considering the mixed objects of these Clubs,
though all belonging to the convivial or jovial system,
strict classification was scarcely attainable: hence chronological
sequence has been adopted, with the advantage
of presenting more connected views of social life than
could have been gained by the former arrangement.</p>

<p>The Second Volume is devoted to the Coffee-house
and Tavern Life, and presents a diversity of sketches,
anecdotes, and reminiscences, whose name is Legion.</p>

<p>To the whole is appended a copious Index, by which
the reader may readily refer to the leading subjects, and
multitudinous contents of the Work.

<h2 class="chap1">ORIGIN OF CLUBS.</h2>

<p>The Club, in the general acceptation of the term, may
be regarded as one of the earliest offshoots of Man's
habitually gregarious and social inclination; and as an
instance of that remarkable influence which, in an early
stage of society, the powers of Nature exercise over the
fortunes of mankind. It may not be traceable to the
time</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"When Adam dolve, and Eve span;"</p>
</div>

<p>but, it is natural to imagine that concurrent with the
force of numbers must have increased the tendency of
men to associate for some common object. This may
have been the enjoyment of the staple of life; for, our
elegant Essayist, writing with ages of experience at his
beck, has truly said, "all celebrated Clubs were founded
upon eating and drinking, which are points where most
men agree, and in which the learned and the illiterate,
the dull and the airy, the philosopher and the buffoon,
can all of them bear a part."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>For special proof of the antiquity of the practice it
may suffice to refer to the polished Athenians, who had,
besides their general <i>symposia</i>, friendly meetings, where
every one sent his own portion of the feast, bore a proportionate
part of the expense, or gave a pledge at a
fixed price. A regard for clubbism existed even in
Lycurgan Sparta: the public tables consisted generally
of fifteen persons each, and all vacancies were filled up
by ballot, in which unanimous consent was indispensable
for election; and the other laws, as described by Plutarch,
differ but slightly from those of modern Clubs.
Justus Lipsius mentions a bonâ fide Roman Club, the
members of which were bound by certain organized
rules and regulations. Cicero records (<i>De Senectute</i>) the
pleasure he took in frequenting the meetings of those
social parties of his time, termed confraternities, where,
according to a good old custom, a president was appointed;
and he adds that the principal satisfaction he
received from such entertainments, arose much less from
the pleasures of the palate than from the opportunity
thereby afforded him of enjoying excellent company and
conversation.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The cognomen Club claims descent from the Anglo-Saxon;
for Skinner derives it from <i>clifian, cleofian</i> (our
cleave), from the division of the reckoning among the
guests around the table. The word signifies uniting to
divide, like <i>clave</i>, including the correlative meanings to
<i>adhere</i> and to separate. "In conclusion, <i>Club</i> is evidently,
as far as form is concerned, derived from <i>cleave</i>"
(to split), but in <i>signification</i> it would seem to be more
closely allied to <i>cleave</i> (to adhere). It is not surprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
that two verbs, identical in form (in Eng.) and connected
in signification, should sometimes coalesce.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>To the Friday-street or more properly Bread-street
Club, said to have been originated by Sir Walter Raleigh,
was long assigned the priority of date in England; but
we have an instance of two centuries earlier. In the
reign of Henry IV., there was a Club called "La Court
de bone Compagnie," of which the worthy old poet
Occleve was a member, and probably Chaucer. In the
works of the former are two ballads, written about 1413;
one, a congratulation from the brethren to Henry Somer,
on his appointment of the Sub-Treasurer of the Exchequer,
and who received Chaucer's pension for him.
In the other ballad, Occleve, after dwelling on some of
their rules and observances, gives Somer notice that he
is expected to be in the chair at their next meeting, and
that the "styward" has warned him that he is</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i7">"for the dyner arraye</p>
<p>Ageyn Thirsday next, and nat is delaye."</p>
</div>

<p>That there were certain conditions to be observed by
this Society, appears from the latter epistle, which commences
with an answer to a letter of remonstrance the
"Court" has received from Henry Somer, against some
undue extravagance, and a breach of their rules.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This
Society of four centuries and a half since was evidently
a jovial company.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Still, we do not yet find the term "Club." Mr.
Carlyle, in his <i>History of Frederick the Great</i>, assumes
that the vow of the Chivalry Orders&mdash;<i>Gelübde</i>&mdash;in vogue
about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1190, "passed to us in a singularly dwindled
condition: Club we now call it." To this it is objected
that the mere resemblance in sound of <i>Gelübde</i> and
<i>Club</i> is inconclusive, for the Orders of Templars, Hospitallers,
and Prussian Knights, were never called clubs in
England; and the origin of the noun need not be sought
for beyond its verb to <i>club</i>, when persons joined in
paying the cost of the mutual entertainment. Moreover,
<i>Klubb</i> in German means the social <i>club</i>; and that word
is borrowed from the English, the native word being
<i>Zeche</i>, which, from its root and compound, conveys the
idea generally of joint expenditure, and specially in
drinking.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>About the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of
the seventeenth century, there was established the
famous Club at the Mermaid Tavern, in Bread-street,
of which Shakspeare, Beaumont, Fletcher, Raleigh, Selden,
Donne, &amp;c., were members. Ben Jonson had a
Club, of which he appears to have been the founder, that
met at the Devil Tavern, between Middle-Temple gate
and Temple Bar.</p>

<p>Not until shortly after this date do we find the word
Club. Aubrey says: "We now use the word <i>clubbe</i> for
a sodality in a taverne." In 1659, Aubrey became a
member of the Rota, a political Club, which met at the
Turk's Head, in New Palace Yard: "here we had," says
Aubrey, "(very formally) a <i>balloting box</i>, and balloted
how things should be carried, by way of Tentamens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
The room was every evening as full as it could be
crammed."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Of this Rota political Club we shall
presently say more. It is worthy of notice that politics
were thus early introduced into English Club-life.
Dryden, some twenty years after the above date, asks:
"What right has any man to meet in factious Clubs to
vilify the Government?"</p>

<p>Three years after the Great Fire, in 1669, there was
established in the City, the Civil Club, which exists to
this day. All the members are citizens, and are proud
of their Society, on account of its antiquity, and of its
being the only Club which attaches to its staff the reputed
office of a chaplain. The members appear to have first
<i>clubbed</i> together for the sake of mutual aid and support;
but the name of the founder of the Club, and the circumstances
of its origin, have unfortunately been lost
with its early records. The time at which it was established
was one of severe trials, when the Great Plague
and the Great Fire had broken up much society, and
many old associations; the object and recommendation
being, as one of the rules express it, "that members
should give preference to each other in their respective
callings;" and that "but one person of the same trade
or profession should be a member of the Club." This
is the rule of the old middle-class clubs called "One of
a Trade."</p>

<p>The Civil Club met for many years at the Old Ship
Tavern, in Water-lane, upon which being taken down,
the Club removed to the New Corn Exchange Tavern,
in Mark Lane. The records, which are extant, show
among former members Parliament men, baronets, and
aldermen; the chaplain is the incumbent of St. Olave-by-the-Tower,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Hart-street. Two high carved chairs,
bearing date 1669, are used by the stewards.</p>

<p>At the time of the Revolution, the Treason Club, as
it was commonly called, met at the Rose tavern, in
Covent Garden, to consult with Lord Colchester, Mr.
Thomas Wharton, Colonel Talmash, Colonel Godfrey,
and many others of their party; and it was there
resolved that the regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel
Langstone's command should desert entire, as they did,
on Sunday, Nov. 1688.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In Friday-street, Cheapside, was held the Wednesday
Club, at which, in 1695, certain conferences took place
under the direction of William Paterson, which ultimately
led to the establishment of the Bank of England.
Such is the general belief; but Mr. Saxe Bannister, in
his <i>Life of Paterson</i>, p. 93, observes: "It has been a
matter of much doubt whether the Bank of England was
originally proposed from a Club or Society in the City
of London. The <i>Dialogue Conferences of the Wednesday
Club</i>, in <i>Friday-street</i>, have been quoted as if first
published in 1695. No such publication has been met
with of a date before 1706;" and Mr. Bannister states
his reasons for supposing it was not preceded by any
other book. Still, Paterson wrote the papers entitled
the <i>Wednesday Club Conferences</i>.</p>

<p>Club is defined by Dr. Johnson to be "an assembly of
good fellows, meeting under certain conditions;" but by
Todd, "an association of persons subjected to particular
rules." It is plain that the latter definition is at least
not that of a Club, as distinguished from any other kind
of association; although it may be more comprehensive
than is necessary, to take in all the gatherings that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
modern times have assumed the name of Clubs. Johnson's,
however, is the more exact account of the true old
English Club.</p>

<p>The golden period of the Clubs was, however, in the
time of the <i>Spectator</i>, in whose rich humour their memories
are embalmed. "Man," writes Addison, in No. 9,
"is said to be a sociable animal; and as an instance of it
we may observe, that we take all occasions and pretences
of forming ourselves into those little nocturnal assemblies,
which are commonly known by the name of Clubs.
When a set of men find themselves agree in any particular,
though never so trivial, they establish themselves
into a kind of fraternity, and meet once or twice a week,
upon the account of such a fantastic resemblance."</p>

<p>Pall Mall was noted for its tavern Clubs more than
two centuries since. "The first time that Pepys mentions
Pell Mell," writes Cunningham, "is under the 26th
of July, 1660, where he says 'We went to Wood's (our
old house for clubbing), 'and there we spent till ten at
night.' This is not only one of the earliest references to
Pall Mall as an inhabited locality, but one of the earliest
uses of the word 'clubbing,' in its modern signification
of a Club, and additionally interesting, seeing that the
street still maintains what Johnson would have called
its 'clubbable' character."</p>

<p>In <i>Spence's Anecdotes</i> (<i>Supplemental</i>,) we read:
"There was a Club held at the King's Head, in Pall
Mall, that arrogantly called itself 'The World.' Lord
Stanhope, then (now Lord Chesterfield), Lord Herbert,
&amp;c., were members. Epigrams were proposed to be
written on the glasses, by each member after dinner;
once, when Dr. Young was invited thither, the Doctor
would have declined writing, because he had no diamond:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Lord Stanhope lent him his, and he wrote immediately&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o2">"'Accept a miracle, instead of wit;</p>
<p>See two dull lines with Stanhope's pencil writ.'"</p>
</div>

<p>The first modern Club mansion in Pall Mall was
No. 86, opened as a subscription house, called the Albion
Hotel. It was originally built for Edward Duke of
York, brother of George III., and is now the office of
Ordnance, (correspondence.)</p>

<h2>THE MERMAID CLUB.</h2>

<p>This famous Club was held at the Mermaid Tavern,
which was long said to have stood in Friday-street,
Cheapside; but Ben Jonson has, in his own verse, settled
it in <i>Bread-street</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"At Bread-street's Mermaid having dined and merry,</p>
<p>Proposed to go to Holborn in a wherry."</p>
<p class="i8"><i>Ben Jonson</i>, ed. <i>Gifford</i>, viii. 242.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Hunter also, in his Notes on Shakspeare, tells us
that "Mr. Johnson, at the Mermaid, in Bread-street,
vintner, occurs as creditor for 17<i>s.</i> in a schedule annexed
to the will of Albain Butler, of Clifford's Inn, gentleman,
in 1603." Mr. Burn, in the <i>Beaufoy Catalogue</i>, also explains:
"the Mermaid in Bread-street, the Mermaid in
Friday-street, and the Mermaid in Cheap, were all one
and the same. The tavern, situated behind, had a way
to it from these thoroughfares, but was nearer to Bread-street
than Friday-street." In a note, Mr. Burn adds:
"The site of the Mermaid is clearly defined from the circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of W. R., a haberdasher of small wares, 'twixt
Wood-street and Milk-street,' adopting the same sign
'over against the Mermaid Tavern in Cheapside.'" The
Tavern was destroyed in the Great Fire.</p>

<p>Here Sir Walter Raleigh is traditionally said to have
instituted "The Mermaid Club." Gifford has thus described
the Club, adopting the tradition and the Friday-street
location: "About this time [1603] Jonson probably
began to acquire that turn for conviviality for
which he was afterwards noted. Sir Walter Raleigh,
previously to his unfortunate engagement with the
wretched Cobham and others, had instituted a meeting
of <i>beaux esprits</i> at the Mermaid, a celebrated tavern in
Friday-street. Of this Club, which combined more talent
and genius than ever met together before or since, our
author was a member; and here for many years he regularly
repaired, with Shakspeare, Beaumont, Fletcher,
Selden, Cotton, Carew, Martin, Donne, and many others,
whose names, even at this distant period, call up a mingled
feeling of reverence and respect." But this is
doubted. A writer in the <i>Athenæum</i>, Sept. 16, 1865,
states: "The origin of the common tale of Raleigh founding
the Mermaid Club, of which Shakspeare is said to
have been a member, has not been traced. Is it older
than Gifford?" Again: "Gifford's apparent invention
of the Mermaid Club. Prove to us that Raleigh founded
the Mermaid Club, that the wits attended it under his
presidency, and you will have made a real contribution
to our knowledge of Shakspeare's time, even if you fail
to show that our Poet was a member of that Club."
The tradition, it is thought, must be added to the long
list of Shakspearian doubts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Fuller has described the wit-combats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
between Shakspeare and Ben Jonson, "which he beheld,"
meaning with his mind's eye, for he was only eight years
of age when Shakspeare died; "a circumstance," says
Mr. Charles Knight, "which appears to have been forgotten
by some who have written of these matters." But
we have a noble record left of the wit-combats in the
celebrated epistle of Beaumont to Jonson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Methinks the little wit I had is lost</p>
<p>Since I saw you; for wit is like a rest</p>
<p>Held up at tennis, which men do the best</p>
<p>With the best gamesters: what things have we seen</p>
<p>Done at the Mermaid! heard words that have been</p>
<p>So nimble, and so full of subtile flame,</p>
<p>As if that every one from whence they came</p>
<p>Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,</p>
<p>And had resolv'd to live a fool the rest</p>
<p>Of his dull life; then when there hath been thrown</p>
<p>Wit able enough to justify the town</p>
<p>For three days past, wit that might warrant be</p>
<p>For the whole city to talk foolishly</p>
<p>'Till that were cancell'd: and when that was gone</p>
<p>We left an air behind us, which alone</p>
<p>Was able to make the two next companies</p>
<p>Right witty; though but downright fools, mere wise."</p>
</div>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE APOLLO CLUB.</h2>

<p>The noted tavern, with the sign of St. Dunstan pulling
the Devil by the nose, stood between Temple Bar and
the Middle Temple gate. It was a house of great resort
in the reign of James I., and then kept by Simon
Wadloe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>In Ben Jonson's <i>Staple of News</i>, played in 1625,
Pennyboy Canter advises, to</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i5">"Dine in Apollo, with Pecunia</p>
<p>At brave Duke Wadloe's."</p>
</div>

<p>Pennyboy junior replies&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i6">"Content, i' th' faith;</p>
<p>Our meal shall be brought thither; Simon the King</p>
<p>Will bid us welcome."</p>
</div>

<p>At what period Ben Jonson began to frequent this
tavern is not certain; but we have his record that
he wrote <i>The Devil is an Asse</i>, played in 1616, when
he and his boys (adopted sons) "drank bad wine at the
Devil." The principal room was called "the Oracle of
Apollo," a large room evidently built apart from the
tavern; and from Prior's and Charles Montagu's <i>Hind
and Panther Transversed</i>, it is shown to have been an
upper apartment, or on the first story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Hence to the Devil&mdash;</p>
<p>Thus to the place where Jonson sat, we climb,</p>
<p>Leaning on the same rail that guided him."</p>
</div>

<p>Above the door was the bust of Apollo; and the following
verses, "the Welcome," were inscribed in gold
letters upon a black board, and "placed over the door at
the entrance into the Apollo:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Welcome all, who lead or follow,</p>
<p>To the <i>Oracle of Apollo</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>Here he speaks out of his pottle,</p>
<p>Or the tripos, his Tower bottle;</p>
<p>All his answers are divine,</p>
<p>Truth itself doth flow in wine.</p>
<p>Hang up all the poor hop-drinkers,</p>
<p>Cries old Sim the king of skinkers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>
<p>He that half of life abuses,</p>
<p>That sits watering with the Muses.</p>
<p>Those dull girls no good can mean us;</p>
<p>Wine it is the milk of Venus,</p>
<p>And the Poet's horse accounted:</p>
<p>Ply it, and you all are mounted.</p>
<p>'Tis the true Ph&oelig;beian liquor,</p>
<p>Cheers the brain, makes wit the quicker,</p>
<p>Pays all debts, cures all diseases,</p>
<p>And at once three senses pleases.</p>
<p>Welcome all, who lead or follow,</p>
<p>To the <i>Oracle of Apollo</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>Beneath these verses was the name of the author,
thus inscribed&mdash;"O Rare Ben Jonson," a posthumous
tribute from his grave in Westminster Abbey. The
bust appears modelled from the Apollo Belvedere, by
some skillful person of the olden day, but has been
several times painted. "The Welcome," originally inscribed
in gold letters, on a thick black-painted board,
has since been wholly repainted and gilded; but the
old thickly-lettered inscription of Ben's day may be
seen as an embossment upon the modern painted background.
These poetic memorials are both preserved in
the banking-house of the Messrs. Child.</p>

<p>"The Welcome," says Mr. Burn, "it may be inferred,
was placed in the interior of the room; so also,
above the fireplace, were the Rules of the Club, said by
early writers to have been inscribed in marble, but were
in truth gilded letters upon a black-painted board, similar
to the verses of the Welcome. These Rules are justly
admired for the conciseness and elegance of the Latinity."
They have been felicitously translated by Alexander
Broome, one of the wits who frequented the
Devil, and who was one of Ben Jonson's twelve adopted
poetical sons. Latin inscriptions were also placed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
other directions, to adorn the house. Over the clock in
the kitchen, in 1731, there remained "<i>Si nocturna tibi
noceat potatio vini, hoc in mane bibes iterum, et fuerit
medicina</i>." Aubrey reports his uncle Danvers to have
said that "Ben Jonson, to be near the Devil tavern, in
King James's time, lived without Temple-barre, at a
combemaker's shop, about the Elephant and Castle;"
and James, Lord Scudamore has, in his <i>Homer à la
Mode</i>, a travesty, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i5">"Apollo had a flamen,</p>
<p>Who in's temple did say Amen."</p>
</div>

<p>This personage certainly Ben Jonson represented in
the great room of the Devil tavern. Hither came all
who desired to be "sealed of the tribe of Ben." "The
<i>Leges Conviviales</i>," says Leigh Hunt, "which Jonson
wrote for his Club, and which are to be found in his
works, are composed in his usual style of elaborate and
compiled learning, not without a taste of that dictatorial
self-sufficiency, which, notwithstanding all that has
been said by his advocates, and the good qualities he
undoubtedly possessed, forms an indelible part of his
character. 'Insipida poemata,' says he, 'nulla <i>recitantur</i>'
(Let nobody repeat to us insipid poetry); as
if all that he should read of his own must infallibly
be otherwise. The Club at the Devil does not appear to
have resembled the higher one at the Mermaid, where
Shakspeare and Beaumont used to meet him. He most
probably had it all to himself."</p>

<p>In the Rules of the Apollo Club, women of character
were not excluded from attending the meetings&mdash;<i>Probæ
feminæ non repudiantur</i>. Marmion, one of Jonson's
contemporary dramatists, describes him in his presidential
chair, as "the boon Delphic god:"&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">"<i>Careless.</i><span class="soft8">I am full</span></p>
<p>Of Oracles. I am come from Apollo.</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Emilia.</i> From Apollo!</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Careless.</i><span class="soft6">From the heaven</span></p>
<p>Of my delight, where the boon Delphic god</p>
<p>Drinks sack, and keeps his bacchanalia,</p>
<p>And has his incense and his altars smoaking,</p>
<p>And speaks in sparkling prophecies; thence I come,</p>
<p>My brains perfumed with the rich Indian vapour,</p>
<p>And heightened with conceits. From tempting beauties,</p>
<p>From dainty music and poetic strains,</p>
<p>From bowls of nectar and ambrosial dishes,</p>
<p>From witty varlets, fine companions,</p>
<p>And from a mighty continent of pleasure,</p>
<p>Sails thy brave Careless."</p>
</div>

<p>Randolph was by Ben Jonson, adopted for his son,
and that upon the following occasion. "Mr. Randolph
having been at London so long as that he might truly
have had a parley with his <i>Empty Purse</i>, was resolved to
see Ben Jonson, with his associates, which, as he heard,
at a set time kept a Club together at the Devil Tavern,
neere Temple Bar: accordingly, at the time appointed, he
went thither, but being unknown to them, and wanting
money, which to an ingenious spirit is the most
daunting thing in the world, he peeped in the room
where they were, which being espied by Ben Jonson, and
seeing him in a scholar's threadbare habit, 'John Bo-peep,'
says he, 'come in,' which accordingly he did;
when immediately they began to rhyme upon the meanness
of his clothes, asking him if he could not make a
verse? and without to call for a quart of sack: there
being four of them, he immediately thus replied,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I, John Bo-peep, to you four sheep,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">With each one his good fleece;</p>
<p>If that you are willing to give me five shilling,</p>
<p class="i2">'Tis fifteen-pence a-piece."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
"By Jesus!" quoth Ben Jonson (his usual oath), "I
believe this is my son Randolph;" which being made
known to them, he was kindly entertained into their
company, and Ben Jonson ever after called him son.
He wrote <i>The Muses' Looking-glass</i>, <i>Cambridge Duns</i>,
<i>Parley with his Empty Purse</i>, and other poems.</p>

<p>We shall have more to say of the Devil Tavern, which
has other celebrities besides Jonson.</p>

<h2>EARLY POLITICAL CLUBS.</h2>

<p>Our Clubs, or social gatherings, which date from the
Restoration, were exclusively political. The first we
hear of was the noted Rota, or Coffee Club, as Pepys calls
it, which was founded in 1659, as a kind of debating
society for the dissemination of republican opinions,
which Harrington had painted in their fairest colours in
his <i>Oceana</i>. It met in New Palace Yard, "where they
take water at one Miles's, the next house to the staires,
where was made purposely a large ovall
table, with a passage in the middle for Miles to deliver
his coffee." Here Harrington gave nightly lectures on
the advantage of a commonwealth and of the ballot.
The Club derived its name from a plan, which it was its
design to promote, for changing a certain number of
Members of Parliament annually by <i>rotation</i>. Sir
William Petty was one of its members. Round the
table, "in a room every evening as full as it could be
crammed," says Aubrey, sat Milton and Marvell, Cyriac
Skinner, Harrington, Nevill, and their friends, discussing
abstract political questions. Aubrey calls them "disciples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and virtuosi." The place had its dissensions and
brawls: "one time Mr. Stafford and his friends came
in drunk from the tavern, and affronted the Junto;
the soldiers offered to kick them down stayres, but Mr.
Harrington's moderation and persuasion hindered it."</p>

<p>To the Rota, in January, 1660, came Pepys, and
"heard very good discourse in answer to Mr. Harrington's
answer, who said that the state of the Roman
government was not a settled government; and so it
was no wonder the balance of prosperity was in one
hand, and the command in another, it being therefore
always in a posture of war: but it was carried by ballot
that it was a steady government; though, it is true, by
the voices it had been carried before that, that it was an
unsteady government. So to-morrow it is to be proved
by the opponents that the balance lay in one hand and
the government in another." The Club was broken
up after the Restoration; but its members had become
marked men. Harrington's <i>Oceana</i> is an imaginary
account of the construction of a commonwealth in a
country, of which Oceana is the imaginary name.
"Rota-men" occurs by way of comparison in <i>Hudibras</i>,
part ii. canto 3:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"But Sidrophel, as full of tricks</p>
<p>As Rota-men of politics."</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the Rota, there was the old Royalist Club,
"The Sealed Knot," which, the year before the Restoration,
had organized a general insurrection in favour of
the King. Unluckily, they had a spy amongst them&mdash;Sir
Richard Willis,&mdash;who had long fingered Cromwell's
money, as one of his private "intelligencers;" the
leaders, on his information, were arrested, and committed
to prison.

<h2>THE OCTOBER CLUB.</h2>

<p>The writer of an excellent paper in the <i>National
Review</i>, No. VIII., well observes that "Politics under
Anne had grown a smaller and less dangerous game
than in the preceding century. The original political
Clubs of the Commonwealth, the Protectorate, and the
Restoration, plotted revolutions of government. The
Parliamentary Clubs, after the Revolution of 1688, man&oelig;uvred
for changes of administration. The high-flying
Tory country gentleman and country member drank
the health of the King&mdash;sometimes over the water-decanter,
and flustered himself with bumpers in honour
of Dr. Sacheverell and the Church of England, with
true-blue spirits of his own kidney, at the October
Club," which, like the Beef Steak Club, was named
after the cheer for which it was famed,&mdash;<i>October ale</i>;
or rather, on account of the quantities of the ale which
the members drank. The hundred and fifty squires,
Tories to the backbone, who, under the above name,
met at the Bell Tavern, in King Street, Westminster,
were of opinion that the party to which they belonged
were too backward in punishing and turning out the
Whigs; and they gave infinite trouble to the Tory administration
which came into office under the leadership
of Harley, St. John, and Harcourt, in 1710. The
Administration were for proceeding moderately with
their rivals, and for generally replacing opponents with
partisans. The October Club were for immediately impeaching
every member of the Whig party, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
turning out, without a day's grace, every placeman who
did not wear their colours, and shout their cries.</p>

<p>Swift was great at the October Club, and he was
employed to talk over those who were amenable to
reason, and to appease a discontent which was hastily
ripening into mutiny. There are allusions to such negotiations
in more than one passage of the <i>Journal to
Stella</i>, in 1711. In a letter, February 10, 1710-11, he
says: "We are plagued here with an October Club;
that is, a set of above a hundred Parliament men of the
country, who drink October beer at home, and meet
every evening at a tavern near the Parliament, to consult
affairs, and drive things on to extremes against the
Whigs, to call the old ministry to account, and get off
five or six heads." Swift's <i>Advice humbly offered to the
Members of the October Club</i>, had the desired effect of
softening some, and convincing others, until the whole
body of malcontents was first divided and finally dissolved.
The treatise is a masterpiece of Swift's political
skill, judiciously palliating those ministerial errors
which could not be denied, and artfully intimating
those excuses, which, resting upon the disposition of
Queen Anne herself, could not, in policy or decency, be
openly pleaded.</p>

<p>The red-hot "tantivies," for whose loyalty the October
Club was not thorough-going enough, seceded from the
original body, and formed "the March Club," more
Jacobite and rampant in its hatred of the Whigs, than
the Society from which it branched.</p>

<p>King Street would, at this time, be a strange location
for a Parliamentary Club, like the October; narrow and
obscure as is the street, we must remember that a century
ago, it was the only thoroughfare to the Palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
at Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. When
the October was broken up, the portrait of Queen Anne,
by Dahl, which ornamented the club-room, was bought
of the Club, after the Queen's death, by the Corporation
of Salisbury, and may still be seen in their Council-chamber.

<h2>THE SATURDAY, AND BROTHERS CLUBS.</h2>

<p>Few men appear to have so well studied the social
and political objects of Club-life as Dean Swift. One
of his resorts was the old Saturday Club. He tells
Stella (to whom he specially reported most of his club
arrangements), in 1711, there were "Lord Keeper, Lord
Rivers, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Harley, and I." Of the
same Club he writes, in 1713: "I dined with Lord
Treasurer, and shall again to-morrow, which is his day,
when all the ministers dine with him. He calls it
whipping-day. It is always on Saturday; and we do,
indeed, rally him about his faults on that day. I was
of the original Club, when only poor Lord Rivers, Lord
Keeper, and Lord Bolingbroke came; but now Ormond,
Anglesey, Lord Stewart, Dartmouth, and other rabble
intrude, and I scold at it; but now they pretend as
good a title as I; and, indeed, many Saturdays I
am not there. The company being too many, I don't
love it."</p>

<p>In the same year Swift framed the rules of the Brothers
Club, which met every Thursday. "The end of
our Club," he says, "is to advance conversation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
friendship, and to reward learning without interest or
recommendation. We take in none but men of wit,
or men of interest; and if we go on as we began, no
other Club in this town will be worth talking of."</p>

<p>The Journal about this time is very full of <i>Brothers</i>
Arran and Dupplin, Masham and Ormond, Bathurst
and Harcourt, Orrery and Jack Hill, and other Tory
magnates of the Club, or Society as Swift preferred to
call it. We find him entertaining his "Brothers" at
the Thatched House Tavern, in St. James's Street, at
the cost of seven good guineas. He must have been an
influential member; he writes: "We are now, in all,
nine lords and ten commoners. The Duke of Beaufort
had the confidence to propose his brother-in-law, the
Earl of Danby, to be a member; but I opposed it so
warmly, that it was waived. Danby is not above twenty,
and we will have no more boys; and we want but two
to make up our number. I staid till eight, and then
we all went away soberly. The Duke of Ormond's
treat last week cost £20, though it was only four dishes
and four without a dessert; and I bespoke it in order
to be cheap. Yet I could not prevail to change the
house. Lord Treasurer is in a rage with us for being
so extravagant; and the wine was not reckoned neither,
for that is always brought in by him that is president."</p>

<p>Not long after this, Swift writes: "Our Society does
not meet now as usual; for which I am blamed; but
till Treasurer will agree to give us money and employments
to bestow, I am averse to it, and he gives
us nothing but promises. We now resolve to meet
but once a fortnight, and have a committee every other
week of six or seven, to consult about doing <i>some good</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
I proposed another message to Lord Treasurer by three
principal members, to give a hundred guineas to a
certain person, and they are to urge it as well as they
can."</p>

<p>One day, President Arbuthnot gives the Society a
dinner, dressed in the Queen's kitchen: "we eat it in
Ozinda's Coffee-house just by St. James's. We were
never merrier or better company, and did not part till
after eleven." In May, we hear how "fifteen of our
Society dined together under a canopy in an arbour at
Parson's Green last Thursday. I never saw anything so
fine and romantic."</p>

<p>Latterly, the Club removed to the Star and Garter,
in Pall Mall, owing to the dearness of the Thatched
House; after this, the expense was wofully complained
of. At these meetings, we may suppose, the literature
of politics formed the staple of the conversation.
The last epigram, the last pamphlet, the last <i>Examiner</i>,
would be discussed with keen relish; and Swift
mentions one occasion on which an impromptu subscription
was got up for a poet, who had lampooned
Marlborough; on which occasion all the company subscribed
two guineas each, except Swift himself, Arbuthnot,
and Friend, who only gave one. Bolingbroke, who
was an active member, and Swift, were on a footing of
great familiarity. St. John used to give capital dinners
and plenty of champagne and burgundy to his literary
coadjutor, who never ceased to wonder at the ease with
which our Secretary got through his labours, and who
worked for him in turn with the sincerest devotion,
though always asserting his equality in the sturdiest
manner.</p>

<p>Many pleasant glimpses of convivial meetings are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
afforded in the <i>Journal to Stella</i>, when there was "much
drinking, little thinking," and the business which they
had met to consider was deferred to a more convenient
season. Whether (observes a contemporary) the power
of conversation has declined or not, we certainly fear
that the power of drinking has; and the imagination
dwells with melancholy fondness on that state of society
in which great men were not forbidden to be good fellows,
which we fancy, whether rightly or wrongly, must have
been so superior to ours, in which wit and eloquence
succumb to statistics, and claret has given place to
coffee.</p>

<p>The <i>Journal to Stella</i> reveals Swift's sympathy for
poor starving authors, and how he carried out the objects
of the Society, in this respect. Thus, he goes to see
"a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, in a nasty garret, very
sick," described in the Journal as "the author of the <i>Sea
Eclogues</i>, poems of Mermen, resembling pastorals and
shepherds; and they are very pretty, and the thought is
new." Then Swift tells us he thinks to recommend
Diaper to the Society; he adds, "I must do something
for him, and get him out of the way. I hate to have
any new wits rise; but when they do rise, I would encourage
them; but they tread on our heels, and thrust
us off the stage." Only a few days before, Swift had
given Diaper twenty guineas from Lord Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>Then we get at the business of "the Brothers," when
we learn that the printer attended the dinners; and the
Journal tells us: "There was printed a Grub-street
speech of Lord Nottingham, and he was such an owl to
complain of it in the House of Lords, who have taken
up the printer for it. I heard at Court that Walpole,
(a great Whig member,) said that I and my whimsical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Club writ it at one of our meetings, and that I should
pay for it. He will find he lies; and I shall let him
know by a third hand my thoughts of him." ... "To-day
I published <i>The Fable of Midas</i>, a poem printed on
a loose half-sheet of paper. I know not how it will
take; but it passed wonderfully at our Society to-night."
At one dinner, the printer's news is that the Chancellor
of the Exchequer had sent Mr. Adisworth, the author
of the <i>Examiner</i>, twenty guineas.</p>

<p>There were gay sparks among "the Brothers," as
Colonel or "Duke" Disney, "a fellow of abundance of
humour, an old battered rake, but very honest; not an
old man, but an old rake. It was he that said of Jenny
Kingdown, the maid of honour, who is a little old, 'that
since she could not get a husband, the Queen should
give her a brevet to act as a married woman.'"&mdash;<i>Journal
to Stella.</i></p>

<h2>THE SCRIBLERUS CLUB.</h2>

<p>"The Brothers," as we have already seen, was a political
Club, which, having, in great measure served its
purpose, was broken up. Next year, 1714, Swift was
again in London, and in place of "the Brothers,"
formed the celebrated "Scriblerus Club," an association
rather of a literary than a political character. Oxford
and St. John, Swift, Arbuthnot, Pope, and Gay, were
members. Satire upon the abuse of human learning
was their leading object. The name originated as follows.
Oxford used playfully to call Swift <i>Martin</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
from this sprung Martinus Scriblerus. <i>Swift</i>, as is
well known, is the name of one species of swallow, (the
largest and most powerful flier of the tribe,) and Martin
is the name of another species, the wall-swallow, which
constructs its nest in buildings.</p>

<p>Part of the labours of the Society has been preserved
in <i>P. P.</i>, <i>Clerk of the Parish</i>, the most memorable
satire upon Burnet's <i>History of his Own Time</i>, and
part has been rendered immortal by the <i>Travels of
Lemuel Gulliver</i>; but, says Sir Walter Scott, in his
<i>Life of Swift</i>, "the violence of political faction, like a
storm that spares the laurel no more than the cedar,
dispersed this little band of literary brethren, and prevented
the accomplishment of a task for which talents
so various, so extended, and so brilliant, can never again
be united."</p>

<p>Oxford and Bolingbroke, themselves accomplished
scholars, patrons and friends both of the persons and to
genius thus associated, led the way, by their mutual animosity,
to the dissolution of the confraternity. Their
discord had now risen to the highest pitch. Swift tried
the force of humorous expostulation in his fable of the
Fagot, where the ministers are called upon to contribute
their various badges of office, to make the bundle strong
and secure. But all was in vain; and, at length, tired
with this scene of murmuring and discontent, quarrel,
misunderstanding, and hatred, the Dean, who was almost
the only common friend who laboured to compose these
differences, made a final effort at reconciliation; but his
scheme came to nothing, and Swift retreated from the
scene of discord, without taking part with either of his
contending friends, and went to the house of the Reverend
Mr. Gery, at Upper Letcombe, Berkshire, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
he resided for some weeks, in the strictest seclusion.
This secession of Swift, from the political world excited
the greatest surprise: the public wondered,&mdash;the party
writers exulted in a thousand ineffectual libels against
the retreating champion of the high church,&mdash;and his
friends conjured him in numerous letters to return and
reassume the task of a peacemaker; this he positively
declined.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE CALVES' HEAD CLUB.</h2>

<p>The Calves' Head Club, in "ridicule of the memory
of Charles I.," has a strange history. It is first noticed
in a tract reprinted in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>. It is
entitled "<i>The Secret History of the Calves' Head Club;
or the Republican unmasked</i>. <i>Wherein is fully shown
the Religion of the Calves' Head Heroes, in their Anniversary
Thanksgiving Songs on the 30th of January, by
them called Anthems, for the years 1693, 1694, 1695,
1696, 1697. Now published to demonstrate the restless
implacable Spirit of a certain party still amongst us,
who are never to be satisfied until the present Establishment
in Church and State is subverted.</i> The Second
Edition. London, 1703." The Author of this <i>Secret
History</i>, supposed to be Ned Ward, attributed the
origin of the Club to Milton, and some other friends of
the Commonwealth, in opposition to Bishop Nixon, Dr.
Sanderson, and others, who met privately every 30th of
January, and compiled a private form of service for the
day, not very different from that long used. "After the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Restoration," says the writer, "the eyes of the government
being upon the whole party, they were obliged to
meet with a great deal of precaution; but in the reign
of King William they met almost in a public manner,
apprehending no danger." The writer further tells us,
he was informed that it was kept in no fixed house, but
that they moved as they thought convenient. The place
where they met when his informant was with them was
in a blind alley near Moorfields, where an axe hung up
in the club-room, and was reverenced as a principal
symbol in this diabolical sacrament. Their bill of fare
was a large dish of calves' heads, dressed several ways,
by which they represented the king and his friends who
had suffered in his cause; a large pike, with a small one
in his mouth, as an emblem of tyranny; a large cod's
head, by which they intended to represent the person of
the king singly; a boar's head with an apple in its mouth,
to represent the king by this as bestial, as by their other
hieroglyphics they had done foolish and tyrannical.
After the repast was over, one of their elders presented
an <i>Icon Basilike</i>, which was with great solemnity burnt
upon the table, whilst the other anthems were singing.
After this, another produced Milton's <i>Defensio Populi
Anglicani</i>, upon which all laid their hands, and made a
protestation in form of an oath for ever to stand by and
maintain the same. The company only consisted of Independents
and Anabaptists; and the famous Jeremy
White, formerly chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, who no
doubt came to sanctify with his pious exhortations the
ribaldry of the day, said grace. After the table-cloth
was removed, the anniversary anthem, as they impiously
called it, was sung, and a calf's skull filled with wine, or
other liquor; and then a brimmer went about to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
pious memory of those worthy patriots who had killed
the tyrant and relieved their country from his arbitrary
sway: and, lastly, a collection was made for the mercenary
scribbler, to which every man contributed according
to his zeal for the cause and ability of his purse.</p>

<p>The tract passed, with many augmentations as valueless
as the original trash, through no less than nine editions,
the last dated 1716. Indeed, it would appear to
be a literary fraud, to keep alive the calumny. All the
evidence produced concerning the meetings is from
hearsay: the writer of the <i>Secret History</i> had never
himself been present at the Club; and his friend from
whom he professes to have received his information,
though a Whig, had no personal knowledge of the Club.
The slanderous rumour about Milton having to do with
the institution of the Club may be passed over as unworthy
of notice, this untrustworthy tract being the
only authority for it. Lowndes says, "this miserable
tract has been attributed to the author of <i>Hudibras</i>;"
but it is altogether unworthy of him.</p>

<p>Observances, insulting to the memory of Charles I.,
were not altogether unknown. Hearne tells us that
on the 30th of January, 1706-7, some young men in
All Souls College, Oxford, dined together at twelve
o'clock, and amused themselves with cutting off the
heads of a number of woodcocks, "in contempt of the
memory of the blessed martyr." They tried to get
calves'-heads, but the cook refused to dress them.</p>

<p>Some thirty years after, there occurred a scene which
seemed to give colour to the truth of the <i>Secret History</i>.
On January 30, 1735, "Some young noblemen and gentlemen
met at a tavern in Suffolk-street, called themselves
the Calves' Head Club, dressed up a calf's head in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
a napkin, and after some hurras threw it into a bonfire,
and dipped napkins in their red wine and waved them
out of the window. The mob had strong beer given them,
and for a time hallooed as well as the best, but taking
disgust at some healths proposed, grew so outrageous
that they broke all the windows, and forced themselves
into the house; but the guards being sent for, prevented
further mischief. The <i>Weekly Chronicle</i> of February 1,
1735, states that the damage was estimated at 'some hundred
pounds,' and that the guards were posted all night
in the street, for the security of the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>In L'Abbé Le Blanc's Letters we find this account
of the affair:&mdash;"Some young men of quality chose
to abandon themselves to the debauchery of drinking
healths on the 30th of January, a day appointed by
the Church of England for a general fast, to expiate the
murder of Charles I., whom they honour as a martyr.
As soon as they were heated with wine, they began to
sing. This gave great offence to the people, who stopped
before the tavern, and gave them abusive language. One
of these rash young men put his head out of the window
and drank to the memory of the army which dethroned
this King, and to the rebels which cut off his head upon
a scaffold. The stones immediately flew from all parts, the
furious populace broke the windows of the house, and
would have set fire to it; and these silly young men had
a great deal of difficulty to save themselves."</p>

<p>Miss Banks tells us that "Lord Middlesex, Lord
Boyne, and Mr. Seawallis Shirley, were certainly present;
probably, Lord John Sackville, Mr. Ponsonby,
afterwards Lord Besborough, was not there. Lord
Boyne's finger was broken by a stone which came in at
the window. Lord Harcourt was supposed to be present."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Horace Walpole adds: "The mob destroyed part
of the house; Sir William (called Hellfire) Stanhope was
one of the members."</p>

<p>This riotous occurrence was the occasion of some
verses in <i>The Grub-street Journal</i>, from which the following
lines may be quoted as throwing additional light
on the scene:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Strange times! when noble peers, secure from riot,</p>
<p>Can't keep Noll's annual festival in quiet,</p>
<p>Through sashes broke, dirt, stones, and brands thrown at 'em,</p>
<p>Which, if not scand- was <i>brand-alum magnatum</i>.</p>
<p>Forced to run down to vaults for safer quarters,</p>
<p>And in coal-holes their ribbons hide and garters.</p>
<p>They thought their feast in dismal fray thus ending,</p>
<p>Themselves to shades of death and hell descending;</p>
<p>This might have been, had stout Clare Market mobsters,</p>
<p>With cleavers arm'd, outmarch'd St. James's lobsters;</p>
<p>Numskulls they'd split, to furnish other revels,</p>
<p>And make a Calves'-head Feast for worms and devils."</p>
</div>

<p>The manner in which Noll's (Oliver Cromwell's)
"annual festival" is here alluded to, seems to show that
the bonfire, with the calf's-head and other accompaniments,
had been exhibited in previous years. In confirmation
of this fact, there exists a print entitled <i>The
True Effigies of the Members of the Calves'-Head Club,
held on the 30th of January, 1734, in Suffolk Street, in
the County of Middlesex</i>; being the year before the
riotous occurrence above related. This print shows a
bonfire in the centre of the foreground, with the mob;
in the background, a house with three windows, the
central window exhibiting two men, one of whom is
about to throw the calf's-head into the bonfire below.
The window on the right shows three persons drinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
healths; that on the left, two other persons, one of
whom wears a mask, and has an axe in his hand.</p>

<p>There are two other prints, one engraved by the
father of Vandergucht, from a drawing by Hogarth.</p>

<p>After the tablecloth was removed (says the author),
an anniversary anthem was sung, and a calf's-skull
filled with wine or other liquor, and out of which
the company drank to the pious memory of those worthy
patriots who had killed the tyrant; and lastly, a collection
was made for the writer of the anthem, to which
every man contributed according to his zeal or his
means. The concluding lines of the anthem for the
year 1697 are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Advance the emblem of the action,</p>
<p class="i1">Fill the calf's skull full of wine;</p>
<p>Drinking ne'er was counted faction,</p>
<p class="i1">Men and gods adore the vine.</p>
<p>To the heroes gone before us,</p>
<p class="i1">Let's renew the flowing bowl;</p>
<p>While the lustre of their glories</p>
<p class="i1">Shines like stars from pole to pole."</p>
</div>

<p>The laureate of the Club and of this doggrel was
Benjamin Bridgwater, who, alluding to the observance
of the 30th of January by zealous Royalists, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"They and we, this day observing,</p>
<p class="i1">Differ only in one thing;</p>
<p>They are canting, whining, starving;</p>
<p class="i1">We, rejoicing, drink, and sing."</p>
</div>

<p>Among Swift's poems will be remembered "Roland's
Invitation to Dismal to dine with the Calf's-Head
Club":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"While an alluding hymn some artist sings,</p>
<p>We toast 'Confusion to the race of kings.'"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Wilson, in his Life of De Foe, doubts the truthfulness
of Ward's narrative, but adds: "In the frighted
mind of a high-flying churchman, which was continually
haunted by such scenes, the caricature would easily pass
for a likeness." "It is probable," adds the honest biographer
of De Foe, "that the persons thus collected together
to commemorate the triumph of their principles,
although in a manner dictated by bad taste, and outrageous
to humanity, would have confined themselves
to the ordinary methods of eating and drinking, if it
had not been for the ridiculous farce so generally acted
by the Royalists upon the same day. The trash that issued
from the pulpit in this reign, upon the 30th of
January, was such as to excite the worst passions in
the hearers. Nothing can exceed the grosness of language
employed upon these occasions. Forgetful even
of common decorum, the speakers ransacked the vocabulary
of the vulgar for terms of vituperation, and
hurled their anathemas with wrath and fury against the
objects of their hatred. The terms rebel and fanatic
were so often upon their lips, that they became the reproach
of honest men, who preferred the scandal to the
slavery they attempted to establish. Those who could
profane the pulpit with so much rancour in the support
of senseless theories, and deal it out to the people for
religion, had little reason to complain of a few absurd
men who mixed politics and calves' heads at a tavern;
and still less, to brand a whole religious community
with their actions."</p>

<p>The strange story was believed till our own time,
when it was fully disproved by two letters written a few
days after the riotous occurrence, by Mr. A. Smyth, to
Mr. Spence, and printed in the Appendix to his <i>Anecdotes</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
2nd edit. 1858: in one it is stated, "The affair
has been grossly misrepresented all over the town, and
in most of the public papers: there was no calf's-head
exposed at the window, and afterwards thrown into the
fire, no napkins dipt in claret to represent blood, nor
nothing that could give any colour to any such reports.
The meeting (at least with regard to our friends) was
entirely accidental," etc. The second letter alike contradicts
the whole story; and both attribute much of
the disturbance to the unpopularity of the Administration;
their health being unluckily proposed, raised a
few faint claps but a general hiss, and then the disturbance
began. A letter from Lord Middlesex to Spence,
gives a still fuller account of the affair. By the style of
the letter one may judge what sort of heads the members
had, and what was reckoned the polite way of speaking
to a waiter in those days:&mdash;</p>

"Whitehall, Feb. y<sup>e</sup> 9th, 1735.</p>

<p>"Dear <i>Spanco</i>,&mdash;I don't in the least doubt but long

occasion in this good city as any reasonable man could
expect, yet I fancy even those may be improved or increased
before they come to you. Now, that you may
be able to defend your friends (as I don't in the least
doubt you have an inclination to do), I'll send you the
matter of fact literally and truly as it happened, upon
my honour. Eight of us happened to meet together the
30th of January, it might have been the 10th of June,
or any other day in the year, but the mixture of the
company has convinced most reasonable people by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
time that it was not a designed or premeditated affair.
We met, then, as I told you before, by chance upon
this day, and after dinner, having drunk very plentifully,
especially some of the company, some of us going to the
window unluckily saw a little nasty fire made by some
boys in the street, of straw I think it was, and immediately
cried out, '<span class="nobreak">D&mdash;n</span> it, why should not we have a
fire as well as anybody else?' Up comes the drawer,
'<span class="nobreak">D&mdash;n</span> you, you rascal, get us a bonfire.' Upon which
the imprudent puppy runs down, and without making
any difficulty (which he might have done by a thousand
excuses, and which if he had, in all probability, some of
us would have come more to our senses), sends for the
faggots, and in an instant behold a large fire blazing
before the door. Upon which some of us, wiser, or
rather soberer than the rest, bethinking themselves then,
for the first time, what day it was, and fearing the consequences
a bonfire on that day might have, proposed
drinking loyal and popular healths to the mob (out of
the window), which by this time was very great, in
order to convince them we did not intend it as a ridicule
upon that day. The healths that were drank out of the
window were these, and these only: The King, Queen,
and Royal Family, the Protestant Succession, Liberty
and Property, the present Administration. Upon which
the first stone was flung, and then began our siege:
which, for the time it lasted, was at least as furious as
that of Philipsbourg; it was more than an hour before
we got any assistance; the more sober part of us, doing
this, had a fine time of it, fighting to prevent fighting;
in danger of being knocked on the head by the stones
that came in at the windows; in danger of being run
through by our mad friends, who, sword in hand, swore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
they would go out, though they first made their way
through us. At length the justice, attended by a strong
body of guards, came and dispersed the populace. The
person who first stirred up the mob is known; he first
gave them money, and then harangued them in a most
violent manner; I don't know if he did not fling the
first stone himself. He is an Irishman and a priest,
and belonging to Imberti, the Venetian Envoy. This
is the whole story from which so many calves' heads,
bloody napkins, and the Lord knows what, has been
made; it has been the talk of the town and the country,
and small beer and bread and cheese to my friends the
garretteers in Grub-street, for these few days past. I, as
well as your friends, hope to see you soon in town. After
so much prose, I can't help ending with a few verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"O had I lived in merry Charles's days,</p>
<p>When dull the wise were called, and wit had praise;</p>
<p>When deepest politics could never pass</p>
<p>For aught, but surer tokens of an ass;</p>
<p>When not the frolicks of one drunken night</p>
<p>Could touch your honour, make your fame less bright;</p>
<p>Tho' mob-form'd scandal rag'd, and Papal spight."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap left65">"Middlesex."</span></p>
</div>

<p>To sum up, the whole affair was a hoax, kept alive by
the pretended "Secret History." An accidental riot,
following a debauch on one 30th of January, has been
distributed between two successive years, owing to a
misapprehension of the mode of reckoning time prevalent
in the early part of the last century; and there is
no more reason for believing in the existence of a
Calves' Head Club in 1734-5 than there is for believing
it exists in 1864.

<h2>THE KING'S HEAD CLUB.</h2>

<p>Another Club of this period was the "Club of Kings,"
or "the King Club," all the members of which were
called "King." Charles himself was an honorary member.</p>

<p>A more important Club was "the King's Head
Club," instituted for affording the Court and Government
support, and to influence Protestant zeal: it was
designed by the unscrupulous Shaftesbury: the members
were a sort of Decembrists of their day; but they
failed in their aim, and ultimately expired under the
ridicule of being designated "Hogs in armour." "The
gentlemen of that worthy Society," says Roger North,
in his <i>Examen</i>, "held their evening sessions continually
at the King's Head Tavern, over against the Inner
Temple Gate. But upon the occasion of the signal of a
<i>green ribbon</i>, agreed to be worn in their hats in the days
of <i>street engagements</i>, like the coats-of-arms of valiant
knights of old, whereby all warriors of the Society
might be distinguished, and not mistake friends for
enemies, they were called also the <i>Green Ribbon Club</i>.
Their seat was in a sort of <i>Carfour</i> at Chancery-lane
end, a centre of business and company most proper for
such anglers of fools. The house was double balconied
in the front, as may be yet seen, for the clubsters to
issue forth in fresco with hats and no peruques; pipes in
their mouths, merry faces, and diluted throats, for vocal
encouragement of the <i>canaglia</i> below, at bonfires, on
usual and unusual occasions. They admitted all strangers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that were confidingly introduced; for it was a main end
of their Institution to make proselytes, especially of the
raw estated youth, newly come to town. This copious
Society were to the faction in and about London a sort
of executive power, and, by correspondence, all over
England. The resolves of the more retired councils of
the ministry of the Faction were brought in here, and
orally insinuated to the company, whether it were lyes,
defamations, commendations, projects, etc., and so, like
water diffused, spread all over the town; whereby that
which was digested at the Club over night, was, like
nourishment, at every assembly, male and female, the
next day:&mdash;and thus the younglings tasted of political
administration, and took themselves for notable counsellors."</p>

<p>North regarded the Green Ribbon Club as the focus
of disaffection and sedition, but his mere opinions are
not to be depended on. Walpole calls him "the voluminous
squabbler in behalf of the most unjustifiable excesses
of Charles the Second's Administration." Nevertheless,
his relation of facts is very curious, and there
is no reason to discredit his account of those popular
"routs," to use his own phrase, to which he was an eyewitness.</p>

<p>The conversation and ordinary discourse of the Club,
he informs us, "was chiefly upon the subject of <i>Braveur</i>,
in defending the cause of Liberty and Property; what
every true Protestant and Englishman ought to venture
to do, rather than be overpowered with Popery and
Slavery." They were provided with silk armour for
defence, "against the time that Protestants were to be
massacred," and, in order "to be assailants upon fair
occasion," they had recommended to them, "a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
pocket weapon which, for its design and efficacy, had
the honour to be called a <i>Protestant Flail</i>. The handles
resembled a farrier's blood-stick, and the fall was joined
to the end by a strong nervous ligature, that, in its
swing, fell just short of the hand, and was made of
<i>Lignum Vitæ</i>, or rather, as the Poets termed it, <i>Mortis</i>."
This engine was "for street and crowd-work, and lurking
perdue in a coat-pocket, might readily sally out to
execution; and so, by clearing a great Hall or Piazza,
or so, carry an Election by choice of Polling, called
<i>knocking down</i>!" The <i>armour</i> of the <i>hogs</i> is further
described as "silken back, breast, and potts, that were
pretended to be pistol-proof, in which any man dressed
up was as safe as in a house, for it was impossible any
one would go to strike him for laughing, so ridiculous
was the figure, as they say, of <i>hogs in armour</i>."</p>

<p>In describing the Pope-burning procession of the 17th
of November, 1680, Roger North says, that "the Rabble
first changed their title, and were called <i>the Mob</i> in
the assemblies of this Club. It was their Beast of Burthen,
and called first, <i>mobile vulgus</i>, but fell naturally
into the contraction of one syllable, and ever since is become
proper English."</p>

<p>We shall not describe these Processions: the grand
object was the burning of figures, prepared for the occasion,
and brought by the Mob in procession, from the
further end of London with "staffiers and link-boys,
sounding," and "coming up near to the Club-Quality in
the balconies, against which was provided a huge bonfire;"
"and then, after numerous platoons and volleys
of squibs discharged, these <i>Bamboches</i> were, with redoubled
noise, committed to the flames." These outrageous
celebrations were suppressed in 1683.

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>STREET CLUBS.</h2>

<p>During the first quarter of the last century, there were
formed in the metropolis "Street Clubs," of the inhabitants
of the same street; so that a man had but to stir
a few houses from his own door to enjoy his Club and the
society of his neighbours. There was another inducement:
the streets were then so unsafe, that "the nearer
home a man's club lay, the better for his clothes and his
purse. Even riders in coaches were not safe from mounted
footpads, and from the danger of upsets in the huge ruts
and pits which intersected the streets. The passenger
who could not afford a coach had to pick his way, after
dark, along the dimly-lighted, ill-paved thoroughfares,
seamed by filthy open kennels, besprinkled from projecting
spouts, bordered by gaping cellars, guarded by
feeble old watchmen, and beset with daring street-robbers.
But there were worse terrors of the night than
the chances of a splashing or a sprain,&mdash;risks beyond
those of an interrogatory by the watch, or of a 'stand
and deliver' from a footpad." These were the lawless
rake-hells who, banded into clubs, spread terror and dismay
through the streets. Sir John Fielding, in his
cautionary book, published in 1776, described the dangerous
attacks of intemperate rakes in hot blood, who,
occasionally and by way of bravado, scour the streets, to
show their manhood, not their humanity; put the watch
to flight; and now and then murdered some harmless, inoffensive
person. Thus, although there are in London no
ruffians and bravos, as in some parts of Spain and Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
who will kill for hire, yet there is no resisting anywhere
the wild sallies of youth, and the extravagances that flow
from debauchery and wine. One of our poets has given
a necessary caution, especially to strangers, in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Prepare for death, if here at night you roam,</p>
<p>And sign your will before you sup from home;</p>
<p>Some fiery fop with new commission vain,</p>
<p>Who sleeps on brambles 'till he kills his man;</p>
<p>Some frolic drunkard, reeling from a feast,</p>
<p>Provokes a broil, and stabs you in a jest.</p>
<p>Yet, ev'n these heroes, mischievously gay,</p>
<p>Lords of the street, and terrors of the way;</p>
<p>Flush'd as they are with folly, youth, and wine,</p>
<p>Their prudent insults to the poor confine;</p>
<p>Afar they mark the flambeau's bright approach,</p>
<p>And shun the shining train and gilded coach."</p>
</div>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE MOHOCKS.</h2>

<p>This nocturnal fraternity met in the days of Queen
Anne: but it had been for many previous years the favourite
amusement of dissolute young men to form themselves
into Clubs and Associations for committing all sorts of
excesses in the public streets, and alike attacking orderly
pedestrians, and even defenceless women. These Clubs
took various slang designations. At the Restoration
they were "Mums" and "Tityre-tus." They were succeeded
by the "Hectors" and "Scourers," when, says
Shadwell, "a man could not go from the Rose Tavern
to the Piazza once, but he must venture his life twice."
Then came the "Nickers," whose delight it was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
smash windows with showers of halfpence; next were
the "Hawkabites;" and lastly, the "Mohocks." These
last are described in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 324, as a set of
men who have borrowed their name from a sort of cannibals,
in India, who subsist by plundering and devouring
all the nations about them. The president is styled
"Emperor of the Mohocks;" and his arms are a Turkish
crescent, which his imperial majesty bears at present in
a very extraordinary manner engraven upon his forehead;
in imitation of which the Members prided themselves in
tattooing; or slashing people's faces with, as Gay wrote,
"new invented wounds." Their avowed design was
mischief, and upon this foundation all their rules and
orders were framed. They took care to drink themselves
to a pitch beyond reason or humanity, and then made a
general sally, and attack all who were in the streets.
Some were knocked down, others stabbed, and others cut
and carbonadoed. To put the watch to a total rout, and
mortify some of those inoffensive militia, was reckoned a
<i>coup d'éclat</i>. They had special barbarities, which they
executed upon their prisoners. "Tipping the lion" was
squeezing the nose flat to the face, and boring out the
eyes with their fingers. "Dancing-masters" were those
who taught their scholars to cut capers by running swords
through their legs. The "Tumblers" set women on
their heads. The "Sweaters" worked in parties of half-a-dozen,
surrounding their victims with the points of their
swords. The Sweater upon whom the patient turned
his back, pricked him in "that part whereon school-boys
are punished;" and, as he veered round from the
smart, each Sweater repeated this pinking operation;
"after this jig had gone two or three times round, and
the patient was thought to have sweat sufficiently, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
was very handsomely rubbed down by some attendants,
who carried with them instruments for that purpose,
when they discharged him." An adventure of this kind
is narrated in No. 332 of the <i>Spectator</i>: it is there
termed a bagnio, for the orthography of which the writer
consults the sign-posts of the bagnio in Newgate-street
and that in Chancery-lane.</p>

<p>Another savage diversion of the Mohocks was their
thrusting women into barrels, and rolling them down
Snow or Ludgate Hill, as thus sung by Gay, in his
<i>Trivia</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Now is the time that rakes their revels keep;</p>
<p>Kindlers of riot, enemies of sleep.</p>
<p>His scattered pence the flying Nicker flings,</p>
<p>And with the copper shower the casement rings.</p>
<p>Who has not heard the Scourer's midnight fame?</p>
<p>Who has not trembled at the Mohock's name?</p>
<p>Was there a watchman took his hourly rounds</p>
<p>Safe from their blows, or new-invented wounds?</p>
<p>I pass their desperate deeds and mischiefs, done</p>
<p>Where from Snow-hill black steepy torrents run;</p>
<p>How matrons, hooped within the hogshead's womb,</p>
<p>Were tumbled furious thence; the rolling tomb</p>
<p>O'er the stones thunders, bounds from side to side:</p>
<p>So Regulus, to save his country, died."</p>
</div>

<p>Swift was inclined to doubt these savageries, yet went
in some apprehension of them. He writes, just at the
date of the above <i>Spectator</i>: "Here is the devil and all
to do with these Mohocks. Grub-street papers about
them fly like lightning, and a list printed of near eighty
put into several prisons, and all a lie, and I begin to
think there is no truth, or very little, in the whole story.
He that abused Davenant was a drunken gentleman;
none of that gang. My man tells me that one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
lodgers heard in a coffee-house, publicly, that one design
of the Mohocks was upon me, if they could catch me;
and though I believe nothing of it, I forbear walking
late; and they have put me to the charge of some
shillings already."&mdash;<i>Journal to Stella</i>, 1712.</p>

<p>Swift mentions, among the outrages of the Mohocks,
that two of them caught a maid of old Lady Winchilsea's
at the door of her house in the Park with a candle, and
had just lighted out somebody. They cut all her face,
and beat her without any provocation.</p>

<p>At length, the villanies of the Mohocks were attempted
to be put down by a Royal proclamation, issued
on the 18th of March, 1712: this, however, had very
little effect, for we soon find Swift exclaiming: "They
go on still, and cut people's faces every night! but they
sha'n't cut mine; I like it better as it is."</p>

<p>Within a week after the Proclamation, it was proposed
that Sir Roger de Coverley should go to the play,
where he had not been for twenty years. The <i>Spectator</i>,
No. 335, says: "My friend asked me if there would
not be some danger in coming home late, in case the
Mohocks should be abroad. 'I assure you,' says he,
'I thought I had fallen into their hands last night; for
I observed two or three lusty black men that followed
me half-way up Fleet-street, and mended their pace behind
me, in proportion as I put on to get away from
them." However, Sir Roger threw them out, at the
end of Norfolk Street, where he doubled the corner,
and got shelter in his lodgings before they could imagine
what was become of him. It was finally arranged that
Captain Sentry should make one of the party for the
play, and that Sir Roger's coach should be got ready,
the fore wheels being newly mended. "The Captain,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
says the <i>Spectator</i>, "who did not fail to meet me at the
appointed hour, bid Sir Roger fear nothing, for that he
had put on the same sword which he made use of at the
battle of Steenkirk. Sir Roger's servants, and among
the rest, my old friend the butler, had, I found, provided
themselves with good oaken plants, to attend their
master upon this occasion. When he placed him in
his coach, with myself at his left hand, the Captain
before him, and his butler at the head of his footmen in
the rear, we convoyed him in safety to the playhouse."
The play was Ambrose Phillips's new tragedy of <i>The
Distressed Mother</i>: at its close, Sir Roger went out
fully satisfied with his entertainment; and, says <i>the
Spectator</i>, "we guarded him to his lodging in the same
manner that we guarded him to the playhouse."</p>

<p>The subject is resumed with much humour, by Budgell,
in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 347, where the doubts as to
the actual existence of Mohocks are examined. "They
will have it," says the <i>Spectator</i>, "that the Mohocks
are like those spectres and apparitions which frighten
several towns and villages in Her Majesty's dominions,
though they were never seen by any of the inhabitants.
Others are apt to think that these Mohocks are a kind
of bull-beggars, first invented by prudent married men
and masters of families, in order to deter their wives
and daughters from taking the air at unseasonable hours;
and that when they tell them 'the Mohocks will catch
them,' it is a caution of the same nature with that of
our forefathers, when they bid their children have a care
of Raw-head and Bloody-bones." Then we have, from a
Correspondent of the <i>Spectator</i>, "the manifesto of Taw
Waw Eben Zan Kaladar, Emperor of the Mohocks,"
vindicating his imperial dignity from the false aspersions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
cast on it, signifying the imperial abhorrence and detestation
of such tumultuous and irregular proceedings;
and notifying that all wounds, hurts, damage, or detriment,
received in limb or limbs, <i>otherwise than shall be
hereafter specified</i>, shall be committed to the care of
the Emperor's surgeon, and cured at his own expense,
in some one or other of those hospitals which he is erecting
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Among other things it is decreed "that they never
tip the lion upon man, woman, or child, till the clock at
St. Dunstan's shall have struck one;" "that the sweat
be never given till between the hours of one and two;"
"that the sweaters do establish their hummums in such
close places, alleys, nooks and corners, that the patient
or patients may not be in danger of catching cold;"
"that the tumblers, to whose care we chiefly commit
the female sex, confine themselves to Drury-lane and
the purlieus of the Temple," etc. "Given from our
Court at the Devil Tavern," etc.</p>

<p>The Mohocks held together until nearly the end of
the reign of George the First.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>BLASPHEMOUS CLUBS.</h2>

<p>The successors of the Mohocks added blasphemy to
riot. Smollett attributes the profaneness and profligacy
of the period to the demoralization produced by the
South Sea Bubble; and Clubs were formed specially for
the indulgence of debauchery and profaneness. Prominent
among these was "the Hell-fire Club," of which
the Duke of Wharton was a leading spirit:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Wharton, the scorn and wonder of our days,</p>
<p>Whose ruling passion was the lust of praise.</p>
<p>Born with whate'er could win it from the wise,</p>
<p>Women and fools must like him, or he dies.</p>
<p>Though wondering senates hung on all he spoke,</p>
<p>The club must hail him master of the joke."&mdash;<i>Pope.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So high did the tide of profaneness run at this time,
that a Bill was brought into the House of Lords for its
suppression. It was in a debate on this Bill that the
Earl of Peterborough declared, that though he was for
a Parliamentary King, he was against a Parliamentary
religion; and that the Duke of Wharton pulled an old
family Bible out of his pocket, in order to controvert
certain arguments delivered from the episcopal bench.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>MUG-HOUSE CLUBS.</h2>

<p>Among the political Clubs of the metropolis in the
early part of the eighteenth century, one of the most
popular was the Mug-house Club, which met in a great
Hall in Long Acre every Wednesday and Saturday,
during the winter. The house received its name from
the simple circumstance, that each member drank his
ale (the only liquor used) out of a separate mug. The
Club is described as a mixture of gentlemen, lawyers,
and statesmen, who met seldom under a hundred. In
<i>A Journey through England</i>, 1722, we read of this Club:</p>

<p>"But the most diverting and amusing of all is the
Mug-house Club in Long Acre.</p>

<p>"They have a grave old Gentleman, in his own gray
Hairs, now within a few months of Ninety years old, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
is their President, and sits in an arm'd chair some steps
higher than the rest of the company to keep the whole
Room in order. A Harp plays all the time at the lower
end of the Room; and every now and then one or other
of the Company rises and entertains the rest with a song,
and (by the by) some are good Masters. Here is nothing
drunk but Ale, and every Gentleman hath his
separate Mug, which he chalks on the Table where he
sits as it is brought in; and every one retires when he
pleases, as from a Coffee-house.</p>

<p>"The Room is always so diverted with Songs, and
drinking from one Table to another to one another's
Healths, that there is no room for Politicks, or anything
that can sow'r conversation.</p>

<p>"One must be there by seven to get Room, and after
ten the Company are for the most part gone.</p>

<p>"This is a Winter's Amusement, that is agreeable
enough to a Stranger for once or twice, and he is well
diverted with the different Humours, when the Mugs
overflow."</p>

<p>Although in the early days of this Club there was no
room for politics, or anything that could sour conversation,
the Mug-house subsequently became a rallying-place
for the most virulent political antagonism, arising out of
the change of dynasty, a weighty matter to debate over
mugs of ale. The death of Anne brought on the Hanover
succession. The Tories had then so much the
better of the other party, that they gained the mob on
all public occasions to their side. It then became
necessary for King George's friends to do something to
counteract this tendency. Accordingly, they established
Mug-houses, like that of Long Acre, throughout
the metropolis, for well-affected tradesmen to meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and keep up the spirit of loyalty to the Protestant succession.
First, they had one in St. John's-lane, chiefly
under the patronage of Mr. Blenman, member of the
Middle Temple, who took for his motto, "Pro rege et
lege." Then arose the Roebuck Mug-house, in Cheapside,
the haunt of a fraternity of young men, who had
been organized for political action before the end of the
late reign.</p>

<p>According to a pamphlet on the subject, dated in
1717, "the next Mug-houses opened in the City were at
Mrs. Read's, in Salisbury-court, in Fleet-street, and at
the Harp in Tower-street, and another at the Roebuck in
Whitechapel. About the same time several other Mug-houses
were erected in the suburbs, for the reception
and entertainment of the like loyal Societies: viz. one at
the Ship, in Tavistock-street, Covent Garden, which is
mostly frequented by royal officers of the army, another
at the Black Horse, in Queen-street near Lincoln's Inn
Fields, set up and carried on by gentlemen, servants to
that noble patron of loyalty, to whom this vindication of
it is inscribed [the Duke of Newcastle]; a third was set
up at the Nag's Head, in James-street, Covent Garden;
a fourth at the Fleece, in Burleigh-street, near Exeter
Change; a fifth at the Hand and Tench, near the
Seven Dials; several in Spittlefields, by the French refugees;
one in Southwark Park; and another in the
Artillery-ground." Another noted Mug-house was the
Magpie, without Newgate, which house still exists as the
Magpie and Stump, in the Old Bailey. At all these
houses it was customary in the forenoon to exhibit the
whole of the mugs belonging to the establishment, in a
row in front of the house.</p>

<p>The frequenters of these several Mug-houses formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
themselves into "Mug-house Clubs," known severally
by some distinctive name, and each club had its President
to rule its meetings and keep order. The President
was treated with great ceremony and respect: he was
conducted to his chair every evening at about seven
o'clock, by members carrying candles before and behind
him, and accompanied with music. Having taken a
seat, he appointed a Vice-president, and drank the health
of the company assembled, a compliment which the
company returned. The evening was then passed in
drinking successively loyal and other healths, and in
singing songs. Soon after ten they broke up, the President
naming his successor for the next evening; and
before he left the chair, a collection was made for the
musicians.</p>

<p>We shall now see how these Clubs took so active a
part in the violent political struggles of the time. The
Jacobites had laboured with much zeal to secure the
alliance of the street mob, and they had used it with
great effect, in connexion with Dr. Sacheverell, in over-turning
Queen Anne's Whig Government, and paving
the way for the return of the exiled family. Disappointment
at the accession of George I. rendered the
party of the Pretender more unscrupulous; the mob was
excited to greater excesses, and the streets of the metropolis
were occupied by an infuriated rabble, and presented
a nightly scene of riot. It was under these
circumstances that the Mug-house Clubs volunteered,
in a very disorderly manner, to be champions of order;
and with this purpose it became part of their evening's
entertainment to march into the street, and fight the
Jacobite mob. This practice commenced in the autumn
of 1715, when the Club called the Loyal Society, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
met at the Roebuck in Cheapside, distinguished itself
by its hostility to Jacobitism. On one occasion this
Club burned the Pretender in effigy. Their first conflict
with the mob, recorded in the newspapers, occurred on
the 31st of January, 1715, the birthday of the Prince of
Wales, which was celebrated by illuminations and bonfires.
There were a few Jacobite alehouses, chiefly on
Holborn Hill, in Sacheverell's period; and on Ludgate-hill:
the frequenters of the latter stirred up the mob to
raise a riot there, put out the bonfire, and break the
windows which were illuminated. The Loyal Society
men, receiving intelligence of what was going on, hurried
to the spot, and thrashed and defeated the rioters.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November in the same year, the
birthday of King William III., the Jacobite mob made
a large bonfire in the Old Jewry, to burn an effigy of
the King; but the Mug-house men came upon them
again, gave them "due chastisement with oaken plants,"
extinguished their bonfire, and carried King William in
triumph to the Roebuck. Next day was the commemoration
of Gunpowder Treason, and the loyal mob had
its pageant. A long procession was formed, having in
front a figure of the infant Pretender, accompanied by
two men bearing each a warming-pan, in allusion to the
story about his birth; and followed by effigies in gross
caricature of the Pope, the Pretender, the Duke of
Ormond, Lord Bolingbroke, and the Earl of Marr, with
halters round their necks; and all of them were to be
burned in a large bonfire made in Cheapside. The procession,
starting from the Roebuck, went through Newgate-street,
and up Holborn-hill, where they compelled
the bells of St. Andrew's church, of which Sacheverell
was rector, to ring; thence through Lincoln's Inn Fields
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and Covent Garden to the gate of St. James's Palace;
returning by way of Pall Mall and the Strand, and
through St. Paul's Churchyard. They had met with no
interruption on their way, but on their return to Cheapside,
they found that, during their absence, that quarter
had been invaded by the Jacobite mob, who had carried
away all the fuel which had been collected for the bonfire.</p>

<p>On November 17, in the same year, the Loyal Society
met at the Roebuck to celebrate the anniversary of the
Accession of Queen Elizabeth; and, while busy with
their mugs, they received information that the Jacobites
were assembled, in great force, in St. Martin's-le-Grand,
and were preparing to burn the effigies of King William
and King George, along with the Duke of Marlborough.
They were so near, in fact, that their party-shouts of
High Church, Ormond, and King James, must have
been audible at the Roebuck, which stood opposite Bow
Church. The Jacobites were starting on their procession,
when they were overtaken in Newgate Street, by
the Mug-house men from the Roebuck, and a desperate
encounter took place, in which the Jacobites were defeated,
and many of them were seriously injured.
Meanwhile the Roebuck itself had been the scene of
a much more serious tumult. During the absence of
the great mass of the members of the Club, another
body of Jacobites, much more numerous than those engaged
in Newgate Street, suddenly assembled, attacked
the Roebuck Mug-house, broke its windows, and those
of the adjoining houses, and with terrible threats, attempted
to force the door. One of the few members of
the Loyal Society who remained at home, discharged a
gun upon those of the assailants who were attacking the
door, and killed one of their leaders. This and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
approach of the Lord Mayor and city officers, caused
the mob to disperse; but the Roebuck was exposed to
attacks during several following nights, after which the
mobs remained tolerably quiet during the winter.</p>

<p>Early in 1716, however, these riots were renewed with
greater violence, and preparations were made for an
active campaign. The Mug-houses were re-fitted, and
re-opened with ceremonious entertainments. New
songs were composed to stir up the Clubs; and collections
of these Mug-house songs were printed. The
Jacobite mob was heard beating with its well-known
call, marrow-bones and cleavers, and both sides were
well equipped with staves of oak, their usual arms for
the fray, though other weapons and missiles were in
common use. One of the Mug-house songs thus describes
the way in which these street fights were conducted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Since the Tories could not fight,</p>
<p>And their master took his flight,</p>
<p class="i2">They labour to keep up their faction;</p>
<p>With a bough and a stick,</p>
<p>And a stone and a brick,</p>
<p class="i2">They equip their roaring crew for action.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Thus in battle array,</p>
<p>At the close of the day,</p>
<p class="i2">After wisely debating their plot,</p>
<p>Upon windows and stall</p>
<p>They courageously fall,</p>
<p class="i2">And boast a great victory they've got.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But, alas! silly boys!</p>
<p>For all the mighty noise</p>
<p class="i2">Of their 'High Church and Ormond for ever!'</p>
<p>A brave Whig, with one hand,</p>
<p>At George's command,</p>
<p class="i2">Can make their mightiest hero to quiver."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>On March 8, another great Whig anniversary, the
day of the death of William III., commenced the more
serious Mug-house riots of 1716. A large Jacobite
mob assembled to their own watch-cry, and marched
along Cheapside, to attack the Roebuck; but they were
soon driven back by a small party of the Royal Society,
who then marched in procession through Newgate Street,
to the Magpie and Stump, and then by the Old Bailey
to Ludgate Hill. When about to return, they found
the Jacobite mob had collected in great force in their
rear; and a fierce engagement took place in Newgate
Street, when the Jacobites were again worsted. Then,
on the evening of the 23rd of April, the anniversary of
the birth of Queen Anne, there were great battles in
Cheapside, and at the end of Giltspur Street; and in
the immediate neighbourhood of the Roebuck and the
Magpie. Other great tumults took place on the 29th
of May, Restoration Day; and on the 10th of June,
the Pretender's birthday. From this time the Roebuck
is rarely mentioned.</p>

<p>The Whigs, who met in the Mug-house, kept by
Mr. Read, in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, appear to
have been peculiarly noisy in their cups, and thus rendered
themselves the more obnoxious to the mob. On
one occasion, July 20, their violent party-toasts, which
they drank in the parlour with open windows, collected
a large crowd of persons, who became at last so incensed
by some tipsy Whigs inside, that they commenced
a furious attack upon the house, and threatened
to pull it down and make a bonfire of its materials
in the middle of Fleet Street. The Whigs immediately
closed their windows and barricaded the doors, having
sent a messenger by a back door, to the Mug-house in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, begging that the persons
there assembled would come to the rescue. The
call was immediately responded to; the Mug-house
men proceeded in a body down the Strand and Fleet
Street, armed with staves and bludgeons, and commenced
an attack on the mob, who still threatened the
demolition of the house in Salisbury Court. The inmates
sallied out, armed with pokers and tongs, and
whatever they could lay their hands upon, and being
joined by their friends from Covent Garden, the mob
was put to flight, and the Mug-house men remained
masters of the field.</p>

<p>The popular indignation was very great at this defeat;
and for two days crowds collected in the neighbourhood,
and vowed they would have revenge. But
the knowledge that a squadron of horse was drawn up
at Whitehall, ready to ride into the City on the first
alarm, kept order. On the third day, however, the
people found a leader in the person of one Vaughan,
formerly a Bridewell boy, who instigated the mob to
take revenge for their late defeat. They followed him
with shouts of "High Church and Ormond! down with
the Mug-house!" and Read, the landlord, dreading that
they would either burn or pull down his house, prepared
to defend himself. He threw up a window, and presented
a loaded blunderbuss, and vowed he would discharge
its contents in the body of the first man who
advanced against his house. This threat exasperated
the mob, who ran against the door with furious yells.
Read was as good as his word,&mdash;he fired, and the unfortunate
man Vaughan fell dead upon the spot. The people,
now frantic, swore to hang up the landlord from his
own sign-post. They forced the door, pulled down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
sign, and entered the house, where Read would assuredly
have been sacrificed to their fury, if they had found
him. He, however, had with great risk escaped by a
back-door. Disappointed at this, the mob broke the
furniture to pieces, destroyed everything that lay in
their way, and left only the bare walls of the house.
They now threatened to burn the whole street, and
were about to set fire to Read's house, when the Sheriffs,
with a posse of constables, arrived. The Riot Act was
read, but disregarded; and the Sheriffs sent to Whitehall
for a detachment of the military. A squadron of
horse soon arrived, and cleared the streets, taking five
of the most active rioters into custody.</p>

<p>Read, the landlord, was captured on the following
day, and tried for the wilful murder of Vaughan; he
was, however, acquitted of the capital charge, and found
guilty of manslaughter only. The five rioters were also
brought to trial, and met with a harder fate. They
were all found guilty of riot and rebellion, and sentenced
to death at Tyburn.</p>

<p>This example damped the courage of the rioters, and
alarmed all parties; so that we hear no more of the
Mug-house riots, until a few months later, a pamphlet
appeared with the title, <i>Down with the Mug; or Reasons
for suppressing the Mug-houses</i>, by an author who
only gave the initials Sir H&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, but who seems
to have so much of what was thought to be a Jacobite
spirit, that it provoked a reply, entitled the <i>Mug Vindicated</i>.</p>

<p>The account of 1722 states that many an encounter
they had, and many were the riots, till at last the Government
was obliged by an Act of Parliament to put an
end to this strife, which had this good effect, that upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
pulling down of the Mug-house in Salisbury Court, for
which some boys were hanged on this Act, the city has
not been troubled with them since.</p>

<p>There is some doubt as to the first use of the term
"Mug-house." In a scarce <i>Collection of One Hundred
and Eighty Loyal Songs</i>, all written since 1678, Fourth
Edition, 1694, is a song in praise of the "Mug," which
shows that Mug-houses had that name previous to the
Mug-house riots. It has also been stated that the
beer-mugs were originally fashioned into a grotesque
resemblance of Lord Shaftesbury's face, or "ugly mug,"
as it was called, and that this is the derivation of the
word.</p>

<h2>THE KIT-KAT CLUB.</h2>

<p>This famous Club was a threefold celebrity&mdash;political,
literary, and artistic. It was the great Society of Whig
leaders, formed about the year 1700, <i>temp.</i> William
III., consisting of thirty-nine noblemen and gentlemen
zealously attached to the House of Hanover; among
whom the Dukes of Somerset, Richmond, Grafton,
Devonshire, and Marlborough, and (after the accession
of George I.) the Duke of Newcastle; the Earls of
Dorset, Sunderland, Manchester, Wharton, and Kingston;
Lords Halifax and Somers; Sir Robert Walpole,
Vanbrugh, Congreve, Granville, Addison, Garth, Maynwaring,
Stepney, and Walsh. They are said to have first
met at an obscure house in Shire-lane, by Temple Bar,
at the house of a noted mutton-pieman, one Christopher
Katt; from whom the Club, and the pies that formed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
standing dish at the Club suppers, both took their name
of Kit-Kat. In the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 9, however, they
are said to have derived their title not from the maker
of the pie, but from the pie itself, which was called a
Kit-Kat, as we now say a Sandwich; thus, in a prologue
to a comedy of 1700:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"A Kit-Kat is a supper for a lord;"</p>
</div>

<p>but Dr. King, in his <i>Art of Cookery</i>, is for the pieman:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Immortal made, as Kit-Kat by his pies."</p>
</div>

<p>The origin and early history of the Kit-Kat Club is
obscure. Elkanah Settle addressed, in 1699, a manuscript
poem "To the most renowned the President and
the rest of the Knights of the most noble Order of the
Toast," in which verses is asserted the dignity of the
Society; and Malone supposes the Order of the Toast
to have been identical with the Kit-Kat Club: this was
in 1699. The toasting-glasses, which we shall presently
mention, may have something to do with this presumed
identity.</p>

<p>Ned Ward, in his <i>Secret History of Clubs</i>, at once
connects the Kit-Kat Club with Jacob Tonson, "an
amphibious mortal, chief merchant to the Muses." Yet
this is evidently a caricature. The maker of the mutton-pies,
Ward maintains to be a person named Christopher,
who lived at the sign of the Cat and Fiddle, in Gray's
Inn-lane, whence he removed to keep a pudding-pye
shop, near the Fountain Tavern, in the Strand. Ward
commends his mutton-pies, cheese-cakes, and custards,
and the pieman's interest in the sons of Parnassus; and
his inviting "a new set of Authors to a collation of oven
trumpery at his friend's house, where they were nobly
entertained with as curious a batch of pastry delicacies as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
ever were seen at the winding-up of a Lord Mayor's feast;"
adding that "there was not a mathematical figure in
all Euclid's Elements but what was presented to the table
in baked wares, whose cavities were filled with fine eatable
varieties fit for the gods or poets." Mr. Charles Knight,
in the <i>Shilling Magazine</i>, No. 2, maintains that by the
above is meant, that Jacob Tonson, the bookseller, was
the pieman's "friend," and that to the customary "whet"
to his authors he added the pastry entertainment. Ward
adds, that this grew into a weekly meeting, provided his,
the bookseller's friends would give him the refusal of
their juvenile productions. This "generous proposal was
very readily agreed to by the whole poetic class, and the
cook's name being Christopher, for brevity called Kit,
and his sign being the Cat and Fiddle, they very merrily
derived a quaint denomination from puss and her master,
and from thence called themselves of the Kit-Cat Club."</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Book of Days</i>, however, states, that
Christopher Cat, the pastry-cook, of King-street, Westminster,
was the keeper of the tavern, where the Club
met; but Shire-lane was, upon more direct authority,
the pieman's abode.</p>

<p>We agree with the <i>National Review</i>, that "it is hard to
believe, as we pick our way along the narrow and filthy
pathway of Shire-lane, that in this blind alley [?], some
hundred and fifty years ago, used to meet many of the
finest gentlemen and choicest wits of the days of Queen
Anne and the first George. Inside one of those frowsy
and low-ceiled rooms, now tenanted by abandoned women
or devoted to the sale of greengroceries and small coal,&mdash;Halifax
has conversed and Somers unbent, Addison
mellowed over a bottle, Congreve flashed his wit, Vanbrugh
let loose his easy humour, Garth talked and
rhymed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>The Club was literary and gallant as well as political.
The members subscribed 400 guineas for the encouragement
of good comedies in 1709. The Club had its toasting-glasses,
inscribed with a verse, or <i>toast</i>, to some
reigning beauty; among whom were the four shining
daughters of the Duke of Marlborough&mdash;Lady Godolphin,
Lady Sunderland, Lady Bridgewater, and Lady
Monthermer; Swift's friends, Mrs. Long and Mrs. Barton,
the latter the lovely and witty niece of Sir Isaac
Newton; the Duchess of Bolton, Mrs. Brudenell, and
Lady Carlisle, Mrs. Di. Kirk, and Lady Wharton.</p>

<p>Dr. Arbuthnot, in the following epigram, seems to
derive the name of the Club from this custom of toasting
ladies after dinner, rather than from the renowned maker
of mutton-pies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Whence deathless Kit-Kat took his name,</p>
<p class="i1">Few critics can unriddle:</p>
<p>Some say from pastrycook it came,</p>
<p class="i1">And some from Cat and Fiddle.</p>
<p>From no trim beaus its name it boasts,</p>
<p class="i1">Grey statesmen or green wits,</p>
<p>But from this pell-mell pack of toasts</p>
<p class="i1">Of old Cats and young Kits."</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Halifax wrote for the toasting-glasses the following
verses in 1703:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Duchess of St. Albans.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The line of Vere, so long renown'd in arms,</p>

</div>

<p>In Spence's <i>Anecdotes</i> (note) is the following additional
account of the Club: "You have heard of the Kit-Kat
Club," says Pope to Spence. "The master of the
house where the club met was Christopher Katt; Tonson
was secretary. The day Lord Mohun and the Earl of
Berkeley were entered of it, Jacob said he saw they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
just going to be ruined. When Lord Mohun broke
down the gilded emblem on the top of his chair, Jacob
complained to his friends, and said a man who would do
that, would cut a man's throat. So that he had the good
and the forms of the society much at heart. The paper
was all in Lord Halifax's handwriting of a subscription
of four hundred guineas for the encouragement of good
comedies, and was dated 1709, soon after they broke up.
Steele, Addison, Congreve, Garth, Vanbrugh, Manwaring,
Stepney, Walpole, and Pulteney, were of it; so was
Lord Dorset and the present Duke. Manwaring, whom
we hear nothing of now, was the ruling man in all conversations;
indeed, what he wrote had very little merit
in it. Lord Stanhope and the Earl of Essex were also
members. Jacob has his own, and all their pictures, by
Sir Godfrey Kneller. Each member gave his, and he is
going to build a room for them at Barn Elms."</p>

<p>It is from the size at which these portraits were taken
(a three-quarter length), 36 by 28 inches, that the word
Kit-Kat came to be applied to pictures. Tonson had
the room built at Barn Elms; but the apartment not
being sufficiently large to receive half-length pictures, a
shorter canvas was adopted. In 1817, the Club-room
was standing, but the pictures had long been removed;
soon after, the room was united to a barn, to form a
riding-house.</p>

<p>In summer the Club met at the Upper Flask, Hampstead
Heath, then a gay resort, with its races, ruffles,
and private marriages.</p>

<p>The pictures passed to Richard Tonson, the descendant
of the old bookseller, who resided at Water-Oakley, on the
banks of the Thames: he added a room to his villa, and
here the portraits were hung. On his death the pictures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
were bequeathed to Mr. Baker, of Bayfordbury, the representative
of the Tonson family: all of them were included
in the Art Treasures Exhibition at Manchester
and some in the International Exhibition of 1862.</p>

<p>The political significance of the Club was such that
Walpole records that though the Club was generally
mentioned as "a set of wits," they were in reality the
patriots that saved Britain. According to Pope and
Tonson, Garth, Vanbrugh, and Congreve were the three
most honest-hearted, real good men of the poetical
members of the Club.</p>

<p>There were odd scenes and incidents occasionally at
the club meetings. Sir Samuel Garth, physician to
George I., was a witty member, and wrote some of the
inscriptions for the toasting-glasses. Coming one night
to the club, Garth declared he must soon be gone, having
many patients to attend; but some good wine being
produced, he forgot them. Sir Richard Steele was of
the party, and reminding him of the visits he had to
pay, Garth immediately pulled out his list, which numbered
fifteen, and said, "It's no great matter whether I
see them to-night, or not, for nine of them have such bad
constitutions that all the physicians in the world can't
save them; and the other six have such good constitutions
that all the physicians in the world can't kill
them."</p>

<p>Dr. Hoadley, Bishop of Bangor, accompanied Steele
and Addison to one of the Whig celebrations by the
Club of King William's anniversary; when Steele had
the double duty of celebrating the day and drinking his
friend Addison up to conversation pitch, he being hardly
warmed by that time. Steele was not fit for it. So,
John Sly, the hatter of facetious memory, being in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
house, took it into his head to come into the company on
his knees, with a tankard of ale in his hand, to drink
off to the <i>immortal memory</i>, and to return in the same
manner. Steele, sitting next Bishop Hoadley, whispered
him, "<i>Do laugh: it is humanity to laugh</i>." By-and-by,
Steele being too much in the same condition as the hatter,
was put into a chair, and sent home. Nothing
would satisfy him but being carried to the Bishop of
Bangor's, late as it was. However, the chairmen carried
him home, and got him upstairs, when his great complaisance
would wait on them downstairs, which he did,
and then was got quietly to bed. Next morning Steele
sent the indulgent bishop this couplet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Virtue with so much ease on Bangor sits,</p>
<p>All faults he pardons, though he none commits."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Knight successfully defends Tonson from Ward's
satire, and nobly stands forth for the bookseller who
identified himself with Milton, by first making <i>Paradise
Lost</i> popular, and being the first bookseller who threw
open Shakespeare to a reading public. "The statesmen
of the Kit-Kat Club," he adds, "lived in social union with
the Whig writers who were devoted to the charge of the
poetry that opened their road to preferment; the band
of orators and wits were naturally hateful to the Tory
authors that Harley and Bolingbroke were nursing into
the bitter satirists of the weekly sheets. Jacob Tonson
naturally came in for a due share of invective. In a
poem entitled '<i>Factions Displayed</i>,' he is ironically introduced

<h2>THE TATLER'S CLUB<br />
IN SHIRE-LANE.</h2>

<p>Shire-lane, <i>alias</i> Rogue-lane, (which falleth into Fleet-street
by Temple Bar,) has lost its old name&mdash;it is now
called Lower Serle's-place. If the morals of Shire-lane
have mended thereby, we must not repine.</p>

<p>Here lived Sir Charles Sedley; and here his son, the
dramatic poet, was born, "neere the Globe." Here, too,
lived Elias Ashmole, and here Antony à Wood dined
with him: this was at the upper end of the lane. Here,
too, was the <i>Trumpet</i> tavern, where Isaac Bickerstaff
met his Club. At this house he dated a great number
of his papers; and hence he led down the lane, into Fleet-street,
the deputation of "Twaddlers" from the country,
to Dick's Coffee-house, which we never enter without
remembering the glorious humour of Addison and Steele,
in the <i>Tatler</i>, No. 86. Sir Harry Quickset, Sir Giles
Wheelbarrow, and other persons of quality, having
reached the Tatler's by appointment, and it being settled
that they should "adjourn to some public-house, and
enter upon business," the precedence was attended with
much difficulty; when, upon a false alarm of "fire," all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
ran down as fast as they could, without order or ceremony,
and drew up in the street.</p>

<p>The <i>Tatler</i> proceeds: "In this order we marched down
Sheer-lane, at the upper end of which I lodge. When we
came to Temple Bar, Sir Harry and Sir Giles got over,
but a run of coaches kept the rest of us on this side of the
street; however, we all at last landed, and drew up in very
good order before Ben Tooke's shop, who favoured our
rallying with great humanity; from whence we proceeded
again, until we came to Dick's Coffee-house, where I
designed to carry them. Here we were at our old difficulty,
and took up the street upon the same ceremony.
We proceeded through the entry, and were so necessarily
kept in order by the situation, that we were now
got into the coffee-house itself, where, as soon as we had
arrived, we repeated our civilities to each other; after
which we marched up to the high table, which has an
ascent to it enclosed in the middle of the room. The
whole house was alarmed at this entry, made up of persons
of so much state and rusticity."</p>

<p>The <i>Tatler's</i> Club is immortalized in his No. 132.
Its members are smokers and old story-tellers, rather
easy than shining companions, promoting the thoughts
tranquilly bedward, and not the less comfortable to Mr.
Bickerstaff because he finds himself the leading wit
among them. There is old Sir Jeffrey Notch, who has
had misfortunes in the world, and calls every thriving
man a pitiful upstart, by no means to the general dissatisfaction;
there is Major Matchlock, who served in
the last Civil Wars, and every night tells them of his
having been knocked off his horse at the rising of the
London apprentices, for which he is in great esteem;
there is honest Dick Reptile, who says little himself, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
who laughs at all the jokes; and there is the elderly
bencher of the Temple, and, next to Mr. Bickerstaff, the
wit of the company, who has by heart the couplets of
<i>Hudibras</i>, which he regularly applies before leaving the
Club of an evening; and who, if any modern wit or town
frolic be mentioned, shakes his head at the dulness of
the present age, and tells a story of Jack Ogle. As for
Mr. Bickerstaff himself, he is esteemed among them
because they see he is something respected by others;
but though they concede to him a great deal of learning,
they credit him with small knowledge of the world,
"insomuch that the Major sometimes, in the height of
his military pride, calls me philosopher; and Sir Jeffrey,
no longer ago than last night, upon a dispute what day
of the month it was then in Holland, pulled his pipe out
of his mouth, and cried, 'What does the scholar say to
that?'"</p>

<p>Upon Addison's return to England, he found his
friend Steele established among the wits; and they were
both received with great honour at the Trumpet, as well
as at Will's, and the St. James's.</p>

<p>The Trumpet public-house lasted to our time; it was
changed to the Duke of York sign, but has long disappeared:
we remember an old drawing of the Trumpet,
by Sam. Ireland, engraved in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>.</p>

<h2>THE ROYAL SOCIETY CLUB.</h2>

<p>In Sir R. Kaye's Collection, in the British Museum,
we find the following account of the institution of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Society, which at one time numbered among its members
some of the most eminent men in London, in a
communication to the Rev. Sir R. Kaye by Sir Joseph
Ayloffe, an original member:&mdash;"Dr. Halley used to
come on a Tuesday from Greenwich, the Royal Observatory,
to Child's Coffeehouse, where literary people
met for conversation: and he dined with his sister, but
sometimes they stayed so long that he was too late for
dinner, and they likewise, at their own home. They
then agree to go to a house in Dean's-court, between an
alehouse and a tavern, now a stationer's shop, where
there was a great draft of porter, but not drank in the
house. It was kept by one Reynell. It was agreed
that one of the company should go to Knight's and buy
fish in Newgate-street, having first informed himself
how many meant to stay and dine. The ordinary and
liquor usually came to half-a-crown, and the dinner only
consisted of fish and pudding. Dr. Halley never eat
anything but fish, for he had no teeth. The number
seldom exceeded five or six. It began to take place
about 1731; soon afterwards Reynell took the King's
Arms, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and desired Dr. Halley
to go with him there. He and others consented, and
they began to have a little meat. On Dr. Halley's
death, Martin Foulkes took the chair. They afterwards
removed to the Mitre (Fleet-street), for the convenience
of the situation with respect to the Royal Society, and
as it was near Crane-court, and numbers wished to become
members. It was necessary to give it a form.
The number was fixed at forty members; one of whom
was to be Treasurer and Secretary of the Royal Society."</p>

<p>Out of these meetings is said to have grown the
Royal Society Club, or, as it was styled during the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
half century of its existence, the Club of Royal Philosophers.
"It was established for the convenience of certain
members who lived in various parts, that they
might assemble and dine together on the days when the
Society held its evening meetings; and from its almost
free admission of members of the Council detained by
business, its liberality to visitors, and its hospitable reception
of scientific foreigners, it has been of obvious
utility to the scientific body at large." (<i>Rise and Progress
of the Club</i>, privately printed.)</p>

<p>The foundation of the Club is stated to have been in
the year 1743, and in the Minutes of this date are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Rules and Orders to be observed by the Thursday's
Club, called the Royal Philosophers.</i>&mdash;A Dinner to be
ordered every Thursday for six, at one shilling and sixpence
a head for eating. As many more as come to pay
one shilling and sixpence per head each. If fewer than
six come, the deficiency to be paid out of the fund subscribed.
Each Subscriber to pay down six shillings,
viz. for four dinners, to make a fund. A pint of wine
to be paid for by every one that comes, be the number
what it will, and no more, unless more wine is brought
in than that amounts to."</p>

<p>In addition to Sir R. Kaye's testimony to the existence
of a club of an earlier date than 1743, there are in
the Minutes certain references to "antient Members of
the Club;" and a tradition of the ill omen of thirteen persons
dining at the table said to be on record in the Club
papers: "that one of the Royal Philosophers entering
the Mitre Tavern, and finding twelve others about
to discuss the fare, retreated, and dined by himself in
another apartment, in order to avert the prognostic."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Still, no such statement is now to be found entered,
and if ever it were recorded, it must have been anterior
to 1743; curiously enough, thirteen is a very usual
number at these dinners.</p>

<p>The original Members were soon increased by various
Fellows of the Society; and at first the club did not
consist exclusively of Royals; but this arrangement,
not having been found to work well, the membership
was confined to the Fellows, and latterly to the number
of forty. Every Member was allowed to introduce one
friend; but the President of the Royal Society was not
limited in this respect.</p>

<p>We must now say a few words as to the several places
at which the Club has dined. The <i>Society</i> had their
Anniversary Dinner at Pontack's celebrated French
eating-house, in Abchurch-lane, City, until 1746. Evelyn
notes: "30 Nov. 1694. Much importuned to take the
office of President of the Royal Society, but I again declined
it. Sir Robert Southwell was continued. We
all dined at Pontac's, as usual." Here, in 1699, Dr.
Bentley wrote to Evelyn, asking him to meet Sir Christopher
Wren, Sir Robert Southwell, and other friends,
at dinner, to consider the propriety of purchasing Bishop
Stillingfleet's library for the Royal Society.</p>

<p>From Pontack's, which was found to be inconveniently
situated for the majority of the Fellows, the Society
removed to the Devil Tavern, near Temple Bar.</p>

<p>The Minutes record that the <i>Club</i> met at the Mitre
Tavern, in Fleet-street, "over against Fetter-lane," from
the date of their institution; this house being chosen
from its being handy to Crane-court, where the Society
then met. This, be it remembered, was not the Mitre
Tavern now standing in Mitre-court, but "the Mitre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Tavern, <i>in Fleet-street</i>," mentioned by Lilly, in his <i>Life</i>,
as the place where he met old Will. Poole, the astrologer,
then living in Ram-alley. <i>The Mitre, in Fleet-street</i>,
Mr. J. H. Burn, in his excellent Account of the Beaufoy
Tokens, states to have been originally established by
a William Paget, of the Mitre in Cheapside, who removed
westward after his house had been destroyed in the
Great Fire of September, 1666. The house in Fleet-street
was lastly Saunders's Auction-room, No. 39, and
was demolished by Messrs. Hoare, to enlarge the site
for their new banking-house, the western portion of
which now occupies the tavern site. The now Mitre
Tavern, in Mitre court, formerly Joe's, is but a recent
assumption of name.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In 1780, the Club removed to the Crown and Anchor
Tavern, in the Strand, where they continued to dine for
sixty-eight years, until that tavern was converted, in
1848, into a Club-house. Then they removed to the
Freemasons' Tavern, in Great Queen Street; but, in
1857, on the removal of the Royal Society to Burlington
House, Piccadilly, it was considered advisable to
keep the Club meetings at the Thatched House, in St.
James's Street, where they continued until that tavern
was taken down.</p>

<p>During the early times, the docketings of the Club
accounts show that the brotherhood retained the title of
Royal Philosophers to the year 1786, when it seems
they were only designated the Royals; but they have
now settled into the "Royal Society Club." The elections
are always an exciting matter of interest, and the
fate of candidates is occasionally severe, for there are various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
instances of rejections on two successive annual
ballots, and some have been black-balled even on a third
venture: some of the defeated might be esteemed for
talent, yet were considered unclubbable.</p>

<p>Some of the entries in the earliest minute-book are
very curious, and show that the Philosophers did not
restrict themselves to "the fish and pudding dinner."
Here is the bill of fare for sixteen persons, a few years
after the Club was established: "Turkey, boiled, and
oysters; Calves' head, hashed; Chine of Mutton;
Apple pye; 2 dishes of herrings; Tongue and udder;
Leg of pork and pease; S<sup>r</sup>loin of beef; Plum pudding;
butter and cheese." Black puddings are stated to have
figured for many years at every dinner of the Club.</p>

<p>The presents made to the Club were very numerous,
and called for special regulations. Thus, under the date
of May 3, 1750, it is recorded: "Resolved, <i>nem. con.</i>,
That any nobleman or gentleman complimenting this
company annually with venison, not less than a haunch,
shall, during the continuance of such annuity, be deemed
an Honorary Member, and admitted as often as he
comes, without paying the fine, which those Members
do who are elected by ballot." At another Meeting,
in the same year, a resolution was passed, "That any
gentleman complimenting this Society annually with a
Turtle shall be considered as an Honorary Member;"
and that the Treasurer do pay Keeper's fees and carriage
for all venison sent to the Society, and charge it in
his account. Thus, besides gratuities to cooks, there
are numerous chronicled entries of the following tenour:&mdash;"Keeper's
fees and carriage of a buck from
the Hon. P. Yorke, 14<i>s.</i>; Fees, etc., for Venison and
Salmon, £1. 15<i>s.</i>; Do., half a Buck from the Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Hardwick, £1. 5<i>s.</i>; Fees and carriage for a Buck from
H. Read, Esq., £1.3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; Fees for Venison and Game
from Mr. Banks, £1. 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; ... August 15, 1751.
The Society being this day entertained with halfe a
Bucke by the Most Hon<sup>ble</sup> the Marquis of Rockingham,
it was agreed, <i>nem. con.</i>, to drink his health in claret.
Sept. 5th, 1751.&mdash;The Company being entertained with
a whole Bucke (halfe of which was dressed to-day) by
Henry Read, Esq., his health was drunk in claret, as
usual; and Mr. Cole (<i>the landlord</i>) was desired to dispose
of the halfe, and give the Company Venisons instead
of it next Thursday." The following week the largess
is again gravely noticed: "The Company being this day
regaled with the other halfe of Mr. Read's buck (which
Mr. Cole had preserved sweet), his health was again
drank in claret."</p>

<p>Turtle has already been mentioned among the presents.
In 1784, the circumnavigator Lord Anson honoured
the Club by presenting the members with a
magnificent Turtle, when the Club drank his Lordship's
and other turtle donors' healths in claret. On one occasion,
it is stated that the usual dining-room could not
be occupied on account of a turtle being dressed which
weighed 400 lb.; and another minute records that a
turtle, intended to be presented to the Club, died on its
way home from the West Indies.</p>

<p>James Watt has left the following record of one of
the Philosophers' turtle feasts, at which he was present:&mdash;"When
I was in London in 1785, I was received very
kindly by Mr. Cavendish and Dr. Blagden, and my old
friend Smeaton, who has recovered his health, and seems
hearty. I dined at a turtle feast with them, and the select
Club of the Royal Society; and never was turtle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
eaten with greater sobriety and temperance, or more
good fellowship."</p>

<p>The gift of good old English roast-beef also occurs
among the presents, as in the subjoined minute, under
the date of June 27, 1751, when Martin Folkes presided:
"William Hanbury, Esq., having this day entertained
the company with a chine of Beef which was 34 inches
in length, and weighed upwards of 140 pounds, it was
agreed, <i>nem. con.</i>, that two such chines were equal to
half a Bucke or a Turtle, and entitled the Donor to be
an Honorary Member of this Society."</p>

<p>Then we have another record of Mr. Hanbury's munificence,
as well his conscientious regard for minuteness
in these matters, as in this entry: "Mr. Hanbury
sent this day another mighty chine of beef, and,
having been a little deficient with regard to annual payments
of chines of beef, added three brace of very large
carp by way of interest." Shortly after, we find Lord
Morton contributing "two pigs of the China breed."</p>

<p>In addition to the venison, game, and other viands,
there was no end of presents of fruits for dessert. In
1752, Mr. Cole (the landlord) presented the company
with a ripe water-melon from Malaga. In 1753, there
is an entry showing that some <i>tusks</i>, a rare and savoury
fish, were sent by the Earl of Morton; and Egyptian
Cos-lettuces were supplied by Philip Miller, who, in his
Gardener's Dictionary, describes this as the best and
most valuable lettuce known; next he presented "four
Cantaloupe melons, equal&mdash;if not superior&mdash;in flavour
to pine-apples." In July, 1763, it is chronicled that
Lord Morton sent two pine-apples, cherries of two sorts,
melons, gooseberries of two sorts, apricots, and currants
of two sorts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>However, this practice of making presents got to be
unpopular with the Fellows at large, who conceived it
to be undignified to receive such gifts; and, in 1779,
it was "resolved that no person in future be admitted
into the Club in consequence of any present he shall
make to it." This singular custom had been in force
for thirty years. The latest <i>formal</i> thanks for "a very
fine haunch of venison" were voted to Lord Darnley
on the 17th of June, 1824.</p>

<p>The Club Minutes show the progressive rise in the
charges for dinner. From 1743 to 1756 the cost was
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a head. In the latter year it was resolved to give
3<i>s.</i> per head for dinner and wine, the commons for absentees
to remain at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, as before. In 1775, the
price was increased to 4<i>s.</i> a head, including wine, and
2<i>d.</i> to the waiter; in 1801, to 5<i>s.</i> a head, exclusive of
wine, the increased duties upon which made it necessary
for the members to contribute an annual sum for the
expense of wine, over and above the charge of the
tavern bills.</p>

<p>In 1775, the wine was ordered to be laid in at a price
not exceeding £45 a pipe, or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bottle; to have
a particular seal upon the cork, and to be charged by the
landlord at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bottle. The Club always dined on
the Society's meeting-day. Wray, writing of a Club-meeting
in 1776, says that, "after a capital dinner of
venison, which was absolutely perfect, we went to another
sumptuous entertainment, at the Society, where
five electrical eels, all alive, from Surinam, were exhibited;
most of the company received the electrical stroke;
and then we were treated with the sight of a sucking
alligator, very lively."</p>

<p>It has been more than once remarked that a public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
dinner of a large party of philosophers and men of
science and letters generally turns out to be rather a
dull affair; perhaps, through the <i>embarras</i> of talent at
table. Not so, however, the private social Clubs, the
offshoots of Public Societies, like the Royal Society
Club, and others we could mention. The Royals do
not appear to have been at all indifferent to these post-prandial
wit-combats. "Here, my jokes I crack with
high-born Peers," writes a Philosopher, alluding to the
Club dinners; and Admiral Smyth, in his unpublished
<i>Rise and Progress</i>, tells us, that to this day "it unites
hilarity, and the <i>macrones verborum</i> of smart repartee,
with strictures on science, literature, the fine arts&mdash;and,
indeed, every branch of human knowledge."</p>

<p>The administration of the affairs of the Club was minutely
attended to: when, in 1776, it was considered
necessary to revise "the commons," a committee was
appointed for the purpose, consisting of Messrs. Aubert,
Cuthburt, Maskelyne, Russell, and Solander, who decided
that "should the number of the company exceed
the number provided for, the dinner should be made up
with the beefstakes, mutton-chops, lamb-chops, veal-cutlets,
or pork-stakes, instead of made dishes, or any
dearer provisions." And "that twopence per head be
allowed for the waiter" (<i>which seems to have been the regular
gratuity for many years</i>). Then, the General Committee
had to report that the landlord was to charge for
gentlemen's servants, "one shilling each for dinner and
a pot of porter;" and "that when toasted cheese was
called for, he was to make a charge for it."</p>

<p>In 1784, the celebrated geologist, Faujas de Saint-Fond
(Barthélemy,) with four other distinguished foreigners,
partook of the hospitality of the Club, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
which, in 1797, M. Faujas published an account. "He
mentions the short prayer or grace with which Dr.
Maskelyne blessed the company and the food&mdash;the solid
meats and unseasoned vegetables&mdash;the quantities of
strong beer called porter, drank out of cylindrical pewter
pots <i>d'un seul trait</i>&mdash;the cheese to provoke the thirst
of drinkers&mdash;the hob-a-nobbing of healths&mdash;and the
detestable coffee. On the whole, however, this honest
Frenchman seems to have been delighted with the entertainment,
or, as he styles it, 'the convivial and unassuming
banquet,'" and M. Faujas had to pay 'seven
livres four sols' for his commons. Among the lighter
incidents is the record of M. Aubert having received a
present from the King of Poland, begged to have an
opportunity of drinking His Majesty's health, and permission
to order a bottle of Hermitage, which being
granted, the health was drank by the company present;
and upon one of the Club-slips of 1798, after a dinner
of twenty-two, is written, "Seven shillings found under
the table."</p>

<p>The dinner-charges appear to have gradually progressed
from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> per head. In 1858-9 the
Club-dinners had been 25, and the number of dinners
309, so that the mean was equal to 12·36 for each
meeting, the visitors amounting to 49; and it is further
computed, that the average wine per head of late, waste
included, is a considerable fraction less than a pint, imperial
standard measure, in the year's consumption.</p>

<p>Among the distinguished guests of the Club are many
celebrities. Here the chivalrous Sir Sidney Smith described
the atrocities of Djezza Pasha; and here that
cheerful baronet&mdash;Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin&mdash;by relating
the result of his going in a jolly-boat to attack a whale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and in narrating the advantages specified in his proposed
patent for fattening fowls, kept "the table in a roar." At
this board, also, our famous circumnavigators and oriental
voyagers met with countenance and fellowship&mdash;as
Cook, Furneaux, Clerke, King, <i>Bounty</i> Bligh, Vancouver,
<i>Guardian</i> Riou, Flinders, Broughton, Lestock, Wilson,
Huddart, Bass, Tuckey, Horsburgh, &amp;c.; while the
Polar explorers, from the Hon. Constantine Phipps in
1773, down to Sir Leopold M'Clintock, in 1860, were
severally and individually welcomed as guests. But,
besides our sterling sea-worthies, we find in ranging
through the documents that some rather outlandish visitors
were introduced through their means, as Chet Quang
and Wanga Tong, <i>Chinese</i>; Ejutak and Tuklivina,
<i>Esquimaux</i>; Thayen-danega, the <i>Mohawk</i> chief; while
Omai, of Ularetea, the celebrated and popular savage, of
<i>Cook's Voyages</i>, was so frequently invited, that he is
latterly entered on the Club papers simply as <i>Mr.</i> Omai.</p>

<p>The redoubtable Sir John Hill dined at the Club in
company with Lord Baltimore on the 30th of June,
1748. Hill was consecutively an apothecary, actor,
playwright, novelist, botanist, journalist, and physician;
and he published upon trees and flowers, Betty Canning,
gems, naval history, religion, cookery, and what not.
Having made an attempt to enter the Royal Society,
and finding the door closed against him,&mdash;perhaps
a pert vivacity at the very dinner in question sealed
the rejection,&mdash;he revenged himself by publishing an
impudent quarto volume, vindictively satirizing the
Society.</p>

<p>Ned Ward, in his humorous Account of the Clubs
of London, published in 1709, describes "the <i>Virtuoso's</i>
Club as first established by some of the principal members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of the Royal Society, and held every Thursday, at a
certain Tavern in Cornhill, where the Vintner that kept
it has, according to his merit, made a fortunate step
from his Bar to his Coach. The chief design of the
aforementioned Club was to propagate new whims, advance
mechanical exercises, and to promote useless as
well as useful experiments." There is humour in this,
as well as in his ridicule of the Barometer: "by this notable
invention," he says, "our gentlemen and ladies of
the middle quality are infallibly told when it's a right
season to put on their best clothes, and when they ought
not to venture an intrigue in the fields without their
cloaks and umbrellas." His ridicule of turning salt
water into fresh, finding a new star, assigning reasons for
a spot in the moon, and a "wry step" in the sun's progress,
were Ward's points, laughed at in his time, but
afterwards established as facts. There have been greater
mistakes made since Ward's time; but this does not
cleanse him of filth and foulness.</p>

<p>Ward's record is evidence of the existence of the Royal
Society Club, in 1709, before the date of the Minutes.
Dr. Hutton, too, records the designation of Halley's Club&mdash;undoubted
testimony; about 1737, he, Halley, though
seized with paralysis, once a week, within a very short
time of his death, met his friends in town, on Thursdays,
the day of the Royal Society's meeting, at "Dr. Halley's
Club." Upon this evidence Admiral Smyth establishes
the claim that the Royal Society Club was actually established
by a zealous philosopher, "who was at once
proudly eminent as an astronomer, a mathematician, a
physiologist, a naturalist, a scholar, an antiquary, a poet,
a meteorologist, a geographer, a navigator, a nautical
surveyor, and a truly social member of the community&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
a word, our founder was the illustrious Halley&mdash;the
Admirable Crichton of science."</p>

<p>A memorable dinner-party took place on August the
11th, 1859, when among the visitors was Mr. Thomas
Maclear (now Sir Thomas), the Astronomer-Royal at
the Cape of Good Hope, who had just arrived in England
from the southern hemisphere, after an absence of
a quarter of a century. "On this day, were present, so
to speak, the representatives of the three great applications
by which the present age is distinguished, namely,
of <i>Railways</i>, Mr. Stephenson; of the <i>Electric Telegraph</i>,
Mr. Wheatstone; and of the <i>Penny Post</i>, Mr. Rowland
Hill&mdash;an assemblage never again to occur." (<i>Admiral
Smyth's History of the Club.</i>)</p>

<p>Among the anecdotes which float about, it is related
that the eccentric Hon. Henry Cavendish, "the Club-Cr&oelig;sus",
attended the meetings with only money enough
in his pocket to pay for his dinner, and that he may have
declined taking tavern-soup, may have picked his teeth
with a fork, may invariably have hung his hat on the
same peg, and may have always stuck his cane in his
right boot; but more apocryphal is the anecdote that one
evening Cavendish observed a very pretty girl looking
out from an upper window on the opposite side of the
street, watching the philosophers at dinner. She attracted
notice, and one by one they got up and mustered round
the window to admire the fair one. Cavendish, who
thought they were looking at the moon, bustled up to
them in his odd way, and when he saw the real object
of their study, turned away with intense disgust, and
grunted out "Pshaw;" the amorous conduct of his brother
Philosophers having horrified the woman-hating
Cavendish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>Another assertion is that he, Cavendish, left a thumping
legacy to Lord Bessborough, in gratitude for his
Lordship's piquant conversation at the Club; but no
such reason can be found in the Will lodged at Doctors'
Commons. The Testator named therein three of his
Club-mates, namely, Alexander Dalrymple, to receive
5000<i>l.</i>, Dr. Hunter 5000<i>l.</i>, and Sir Charles Blagden
(coadjutor in the Water question), 15,000<i>l.</i> After certain
other bequests, the will proceeds,&mdash;"The remainder
of the funds (nearly 700,000<i>l.</i>) to be divided, one-sixth
to the Earl of Bessborough, while the cousin, Lord
George Henry Cavendish, had two-sixths, instead of one;"
"it is therefore," says Admiral Smyth, "patent that the
money thus passed over from uncle to nephew, was a
mere consequence of relationship, and not at all owing
to any flowers or powers of conversation at the Royal
Society Club."</p>

<p>Admiral Smyth, to whose admirable <i>précis</i> of the
History of the Club we have to make acknowledgment,
remarks that the hospitality of the Royal Society has
been "of material utility to the well-working of the
whole machine which wisdom called up, at a time when
knowledge was quitting scholastic niceties for the truths
of experimental philosophy. This is proved by the number
of men of note&mdash;both in ability and station&mdash;who
have there congregated previously to repairing to the
evening meeting of the body at large; and many a qualified
person who went thither a guest has returned a candidate.
Besides inviting our own princes, dukes, marquises,
earls, ministers of state, and nobles of all grades
to the table, numerous foreign grandees, prelates, ambassadors,
and persons of distinction&mdash;from the King of
Poland and Baron Munchausen, down to the smart little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
abbé and a 'gentleman unknown'&mdash;are found upon
the Club records. Not that the amenities of the fraternity
were confined to these classes, or that, in the Clubbian
sense, they form the most important order; for
bishops, deans, archdeacons, and clergymen in general&mdash;astronomers&mdash;mathematicians&mdash;sailors&mdash;soldiers&mdash;engineers&mdash;medical
practitioners&mdash;poets&mdash;artists&mdash;travellers&mdash;musicians&mdash;opticians&mdash;men
of repute in every acquirement,
were, and ever will be, welcome guests. In a word,
the names and callings of the visitors offer a type of the
philosophical <i>discordia concors</i>; and among those guests
possessed of that knowledge without which genius is
almost useless, we find in goodly array such choice
names as Benjamin Franklin, Sir Joshua Reynolds,
Gibbon, Costard, Bryant, Dalton, Watt, Bolton, Tennant,
Wedgwood, <i>Abyssinian</i> Bruce, Attwood, Boswell,
Brinkley, Rigaud, Brydone, Ivory, Jenner, John Hunter,
Brunel, Lysons, Weston, Cramer, Kippis, Westmacott,
Corbould, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Turner, De La Beche,
<i>et hoc genus omne</i>."</p>

<p>The President of the Royal Society is elected President
of the Club. There were always more candidates
for admission than vacancies, a circumstance which had
some influence in leading to the formation of a new Club,
in 1847, composed of eminent Fellows of the Society. The
name of this new Association is "the Philosophical Club,"
and its object is "to promote, as much as possible, the
scientific objects of the Royal Society, to facilitate intercourse
between those Fellows who are actively engaged
in cultivating the various branches of Natural
Science, and who have contributed to its progress; to
increase the attendance at the Evening Meetings, and to
encourage the contribution and the discussion of papers."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Nor are the dinners forgotten; the price of each not to
exceed ten shillings.</p>

<p>The statistical portion of the Annual Statement of
1860, shows that the number of dinners for the past
year amounted to 25, at which the attendance was 312
persons, 62 of whom were visitors, the average being
= 12·48 each time: and the Treasurer called attention
to the fact that out of the Club funds in the last twelvemonth,
they had paid not less than £9. 6<i>s.</i> for soda and
seltzer water; £8. 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for cards of invitation and
postage; and £25 for visitors, that is, 8<i>s.</i> 0¾<i>d.</i> per head.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE COCOA-TREE CLUB.</h2>

<p>This noted Club was the Tory Chocolate-house of
Queen Anne's reign; the Whig Coffee-house was the
St. James's, lower down, in the same street, St. James's.
The party distinction is thus defined:&mdash;"A Whig will no
more go to the Cocoa-tree or Ozinda's, than a Tory will
be seen at the coffee-house of St. James's."</p>

<p>The Cocoa-tree Chocolate-house was converted into
a Club, probably before 1746, when the house was
the head-quarters of the Jacobite party in Parliament.
It is thus referred to in the above year by Horace Walpole,
in a letter to George Montagu:&mdash;"The Duke has
given Brigadier Mordaunt the Pretender's coach, on
condition he rode up to London in it. 'That I will,
Sir,' said he; 'and drive till it stops of its own accord
at the Cocoa-tree.'"</p>

<p>Gibbon was a member of this Club, and has left this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
entry, in his journal of 1762:&mdash;"Nov. 24. I dined at
the Cocoa Tree with * * *, who, under a great appearance
of oddity, conceals more real humour, good sense,
and even knowledge, than half those who laugh at him.
We went thence to the play (<i>The Spanish Friar</i>); and
when it was over, retired to the Cocoa-tree. That respectable
body, of which I have the honour of being a
member, affords every evening a sight truly English.
Twenty or thirty, perhaps, of the first men in the kingdom
in point of fashion and fortune supping at little
tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a coffee-room,
upon a bit of cold meat, or a sandwich, and drinking
a glass of punch. At present we are full of King's
counsellors and lords of the bedchamber; who, having
jumped into the ministry, make a very singular medley
of their old principles and language with their modern
ones." At this time, bribery was in full swing: it is
alleged that the lowest bribe for a vote upon the Peace
of Fontainebleau, was a bank-note of £200; and that
the Secretary of the Treasury afterwards acknowledged
£25,000 to have been thus expended in a single morning.
And in 1765, on the debate in the Commons on
the Regency Bill, we read in the <i>Chatham Correspondence</i>:
"The Cocoa-tree have thus capacitated Her
Royal Highness (the Princess of Wales) to be Regent:
it is well they have not given us a King, if they have
not; for many think, Lord Bute is King."</p>

<p>Although the Cocoa-tree, in its conversion from a
Chocolate-house to a Club, may have bettered its reputation
in some respects, high play, if not foul play, was
known there twenty years later. Walpole, writing to
Mann, Feb. 6, 1780, says: "Within this week there
has been a cast at hazard at the Cocoa-tree, (in St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
James's Street,) the difference of which amounted to
one hundred and fourscore thousand pounds. Mr.
O'Birne, an Irish gamester, had won one hundred thousand
pounds of a young Mr. Harvey of Chigwell, just
started into an estate by his elder brother's death.
O'Birne said, "You can never pay me." "I can," said
the youth: "my estate will sell for the debt." "No,"
said O.; "I will win ten thousand&mdash;you shall throw for
the odd ninety." They did, and Harvey won."</p>

<p>The Cocoa-tree was one of the Clubs to which Lord
Byron belonged.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>ALMACK'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>Almack's, the original Brookes's, on the south side of
the Whig Club-house, was established in Pall Mall, on
the site of the British Institution, in 1764, by twenty-seven
noblemen and gentlemen, including the Duke of
Roxburghe, the Duke of Portland, the Earl of Strathmore,
Mr. Crewe (afterwards Lord Crewe), and Mr. C. J. Fox.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham was permitted to inspect the original
Rules of the Club, which show its nature: here are
a few.</p>

<p>"21. No gaming in the eating-room, except tossing
up for reckonings, on penalty of paying the whole bill
of the members present.</p>

<p>"22. Dinner shall be served up exactly at half-past
four o'clock, and the bill shall be brought in at seven.</p>

<p>"26. Almack shall sell no wines in bottles that the
Club approves of, out of the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"30. Any member of this Society that shall become
a candidate for any other Club, (old White's excepted,)
shall be ipso facto excluded, and his name struck out of
the book.</p>

<p>"40. That every person playing at the new guinea
table do keep fifty guineas before him.</p>

<p>"41. That every person playing at the twenty guinea
table do not keep less than twenty guineas before him."</p>

<p>That the play ran high may be inferred from a note
against the name of Mr. Thynne, in the Club-books:
"Mr. Thynne having won only 12,000 guineas during
the last two months, retired in disgust, March 21st,
1772."</p>

<p>Some of its members were Maccaronis, the "curled
darlings" of the day: they were so called from their
affectation of foreign tastes and fashions, and were celebrated
for their long curls and eye-glasses. Much of
the deep play was removed here. "The gaming at
Almack's," writes Walpole to Mann, February 2, 1770,
"which has taken the <i>pas</i> of White's, is worthy the decline
of our empire, or commonwealth, which you please.
The young men of the age lose ten, fifteen, twenty
thousand pounds in an evening there. Lord Stavordale,
not one-and-twenty, lost £11,000 there last Tuesday,
but recovered it by one great hand at hazard. He
swore a great oath, 'Now, if I had been playing <i>deep</i>,
I might have won millions.' His cousin, Charles Fox,
shines equally there, and in the House of Commons.
He was twenty-one yesterday se'nnight, and is already
one of our best speakers. Yesterday he was made a
Lord of the Admiralty." Gibbon, the historian, was
also a member, and he dates several letters from here.
On June 24, 1776, he writes: "Town grows empty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
this house, where I have passed many agreeable hours,
is the only place which still invites the flower of the
English youth. The style of living, though somewhat
expensive, is exceedingly pleasant; and, notwithstanding
the rage of play, I have found more entertainment and
rational society than in any other club to which I
belong."</p>

<p>The play was certainly high&mdash;only for rouleaus of £50
each, and generally there was £10,000 in specie on the
table. The gamesters began by pulling off their embroidered
clothes, and put on frieze greatcoats, or turned
their coats inside outwards for luck. They put on pieces
of leather (such as are worn by footmen when they clean
the knives) to save their laced ruffles; and to guard
their eyes from the light and to prevent tumbling their
hair, wore high-crowned straw hats with broad brims,
and adorned with flowers and ribbons; masks to conceal
their emotions when they played at quinz. Each
gamester had a small neat stand by him, to hold his
tea; or a wooden bowl with an edge of ormolu, to hold
the rouleaus.</p>

<p>Almack's was subsequently Goosetree's. In the year
1780, Pitt was then an habitual frequenter, and here his
personal adherents mustered strongly. The members,
we are told in the <i>Life of Wilberforce</i>, were about twenty-five
in number, and included Pratt (afterwards Lord
Camden), Lords Euston, Chatham, Graham, Duncannon,
Althorp, Apsley, G. Cavendish, and Lennox; Messrs.
Eliot, Sir Andrew St. John, Bridgeman (afterwards Lord
Bradford), Morris Robinson (afterwards Lord Rokeby),
R. Smith (afterwards Lord Carrington), W. Grenville
(afterwards Lord Grenville), Pepper Arden (afterwards
Lord Alvanley), Mr. Edwards, Mr. Marsham, Mr. Pitt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Bankes, Mr. Thomas Steele, General
Smith, Mr. Windham.</p>

<p>In the gambling at Goosetree's, Pitt played with
characteristic and intense eagerness. When Wilberforce
came up to London in 1780, after his return to
Parliament, his great success coloured his entry into
public life, and he was at once elected a member of
the leading clubs&mdash;Miles's and Evans's, Brookes's and
Boodle's, White's and Goosetree's. The latter was Wilberforce's
usual resort, where his friendship with Pitt,
whom he had slightly known at Cambridge, greatly increased:
he once lost £100 at the faro-table, and on
another night kept the bank, by which he won £600;
but he soon became weaned from play.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>ALMACK'S ASSEMBLY-ROOMS.</h2>

<p>In the year following the opening of Almack's Club
in Pall Mall, Almack had built for him by Robert
Mylne, the suite of Assembly Rooms, in King-street, St.
James's, which was named after him, "Almack's," and
was occasionally called "Willis's Rooms," after the next
proprietor. Almack likewise kept the Thatched House
Tavern, in St. James's-street.</p>

<p>Almack's was opened Feb. 20, 1765, and was advertised
to have been built with hot bricks and boiling
water: the ceilings were dripping with wet; but the
Duke of Cumberland, the Hero of Culloden, was there.
Gilly Williams, a few days after the opening, in a letter
to George Selwyn, writes: "There is now opened at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Almack's, in three very elegant new-built rooms, a ten-guinea
subscription, for which you have a ball and
supper once a week, for twelve weeks. You may
imagine by the sum the company is chosen; though,
refined as it is, it will be scarce able to put out old Soho
(Mrs. Cornelys) out of countenance. The men's tickets
are not transferable, so, if the ladies do not like us, they
have no opportunity of changing us, but must see the
same persons for ever." ... "Our female Almack's
flourishes beyond description. Almack's Scotch face,
in a bag-wig, waiting at supper, would divert you, as
would his lady, in a sack, making tea and curtseying to
the duchesses."</p>

<p>Five years later, in 1770, Walpole writes to Montagu:
"There is a new Institution that begins to make, and
if it proceeds, will make a considerable noise. It is a
Club of <i>both</i> sexes, to be erected at Almack's, on the
model of that of the men of White's. Mrs. Fitzroy,
Lady Pembroke, Mrs. Meynell, Lady Molyneux, Miss
Pelham, and Miss Lloyd, are the foundresses. I am
ashamed to say I am of so young and fashionable society;
but as they are people I live with, I choose to be
idle rather than morose. I can go to a young supper
without forgetting how much sand is run out of the
hour-glass."</p>

<p>Mrs. Boscawen tells Mrs. Delany of this Club of
lords and ladies who first met at a tavern, but subsequently,
to satisfy Lady Pembroke's scruples, in a room
at Almack's. "The ladies nominate and choose the
gentlemen and <i>vice versâ</i>, so that no lady can exclude a
lady, or gentleman a gentleman." Ladies Rochford,
Harrington, and Holderness were black-balled, as was
the Duchess of Bedford, who was subsequently admitted!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Lord March and Brook Boothby were black-balled by
the ladies, to their great astonishment. There was a
dinner, then supper at eleven, and, says Mrs. Boscawen,
"play will be deep and constant, probably." The
frenzy for play was then at its height. "Nothing
within my memory comes up to it!" exclaims Mrs.
Delany, who attributes it to the prevailing "avarice and
extravagance." Some men made profit out of it, like
Mr. Thynne, "who has won this year so considerably
that he has paid off all his debts, bought a house and
furnished it, disposed of his horses, hounds, etc., and
struck his name out of all expensive subscriptions. But
what a <i>horrid reflection</i> it must be to an honest mind to
<i>build</i> his fortune on the ruin of others!"</p>

<p>Almack's large ball-room is about one hundred feet
in length, by forty feet in width; it is chastely decorated
with gilt columns and pilasters, classic medallions,
mirrors, etc., and is lit with gas, in cut-glass lustres.
The largest number of persons ever present in this room
at one ball was 1700.</p>

<p>The rooms are let for public meetings, dramatic readings,
concerts, balls, and occasionally for dinners. Here
Mrs. Billington, Mr. Braham, and Signor Naldi, gave
concerts, from 1808 to 1810, in rivalry with Madame
Catalani, at Hanover-square Rooms; and here Mr.
Charles Kemble gave, in 1844, his Readings from
Shakspeare.</p>

<p>The Balls at Almack's are managed by a Committee
of Ladies of high rank, and the only mode of admission
is by vouchers or personal introduction.</p>

<p>Almack's has declined of late years; "a clear proof
that the palmy days of exclusiveness are gone by in
England; and though it is obviously impossible to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
any given number of persons from congregating
and re-establishing an oligarchy, we are quite sure that
the attempt would be ineffectual, and that the sense of
their importance would extend little beyond the set."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
In 1831 was published <i>Almack's</i>, a novel, in which
the leaders of fashion were sketched with much freedom,
and identified in <i>A Key to Almack's</i>, by Benjamin
Disraeli.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>BROOKES'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>We have just narrated the establishment of this Club&mdash;how
it was originally a gaming club, and was formed
at first by Almack. It was subsequently taken by
Brookes, a wine-merchant and money-lender, according
to Selwyn; and who is described by Tickell, in a copy
of verses addressed to Sheridan, when Charles James
Fox was to give a supper at his own lodgings, then near
the Club:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Derby shall send, if not his plate, his cooks,</p>
<p>And know, I've brought the best champagne from Brookes,</p>
<p>From liberal Brookes, whose speculative skill</p>
<p>Is hasty credit, and a distant bill;</p>
<p>Who, nursed in clubs, disdains a vulgar trade,</p>
<p>Exults to trust, and blushes to be paid."</p>
</div>

<p>From Pall Mall Brookes's Club removed to No. 60,
on the west side of St. James's-street, where a handsome
house was built at Brookes's expense, from the designs of
Henry Holland, the architect; it was opened in October,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
1778. The concern did not prosper; for James Hare
writes to George Selwyn, May 18, 1779, "we are all
beggars at Brookes's, and he threatens to leave the
house, as it yields him no profit." Mr. Cunningham
tells us that Brookes retired from the Club soon after it
was built, and died poor about the year 1782.</p>

<p>Lord Crewe, one of the founders of the Club in Pall
Mall, died in 1829, after sixty-five years' membership of
Brookes's. Among its celebrities were Burke and Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Garrick and Hume, Horace Walpole,
Gibbon, and Sheridan and Wilberforce. Lord March,
afterwards Duke of Queensberry, was one of its notorieties&mdash;"the
old Q., whom many now living can remember,
with his fixed eye and cadaverous face, watching
the flow of the human tide past his bow-window in
Pall Mall."&mdash;<i>National Review</i>, 1857. [This is hardly
correct as to locality, since the Club left Pall Mall in
1778, and a reminiscent must be more than 80 years
of age.] Among Selwyn's correspondents are Gilly
Williams, Hare, Fitzpatrick, the Townshends, Burgoyne,
Storer, and Lord Carlisle. R. Tickell, in "Lines from
the Hon. Charles Fox to the Hon. John Townshend
cruising," thus describes the welcome that awaits
Townshend, and the gay life of the Club:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Soon as to Brookes's thence thy footsteps bend,</p>
<p>What gratulations thy approach attend!</p>
<p>See Gibbon tap his box; auspicious sign,</p>
<p>That classic compliment and evil combine.</p>
<p>See Beauclerk's cheek a tinge of red surprise,</p>
<p>And friendship gives what cruel health denies.</p>
<p>Important Townshend! what can thee withstand?</p>
<p>The ling'ring black-ball lags in Boothby's hand.</p>
<p>E'en Draper checks the sentimental sigh;</p>
<p>And Smith, without an oath, suspends the die."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Mr. Wilberforce has thus recorded his first appearance
at Brookes's: "Hardly knowing any one, I joined,
from mere shyness, in play at the faro-tables, where
George Selwyn kept bank. A friend, who knew my
inexperience, and regarded me as a victim decked out
for sacrifice, called to me, 'What, Wilberforce, is that
you?' Selwyn quite resented the interference, and,
turning to him, said, in his most expressive tone, 'Oh,
Sir, don't interrupt Mr. Wilberforce; he could not be
better employed!'"</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, one day at Brookes's, expatiating
on that beautiful but far-fetched idea of Dr. Darwin's,
that the reason of the bosom of a beautiful woman being
the object of such exquisite delight for a man to look
upon, arises from the first pleasurable sensations of
warmth, sustenance, and repose, which he derives therefrom
in his infancy; Sheridan replied, "Truly hath it
been said, that there is only one step from the sublime
to the ridiculous. All children who are brought up by
hand must derive their pleasurable sensations from a
very different source; yet I believe no one ever heard of
any such, when arrived at manhood, evincing any very
rapturous or amatory emotions at the sight of a wooden
spoon." This clever exposure of an ingenious absurdity
shows the folly of taking for granted every opinion which
may be broached under the sanction of a popular name.</p>

<p>The conversation at Brookes's, one day, turning on
Lord Henry Petty's projected tax upon iron, one member
said, that as there was so much opposition to it, it
would be better to raise the proposed sum upon coals.
"Hold! my dear fellow," said Sheridan, "that would
be out of the frying pan into the fire, with a vengeance."</p>

<p>Mr. Whitbread, one evening at Brookes's, talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
loudly and largely against the Ministers for laying what
was called the <i>war tax</i> upon malt: every one present
concurred with him in opinion, but Sheridan could not
resist the gratification of a hit at the <i>brewer</i> himself.
He wrote with his pencil upon the back of a letter the
following lines, which he handed to Mr. Whitbread,
across the table:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"They've raised the price of table drink;</p>
<p>What is the reason, do you think?</p>
<p>The tax on <i>malt</i>'s the cause I hear&mdash;</p>
<p>But what has <i>malt</i> to do with <i>beer</i>?"</p>
</div>

<p>Looking through a Number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
one day, at Brookes's, soon after its first appearance,
Sheridan said, in reply to a gentleman who observed
that the editor, Mr. Gifford, had boasted of the power of
conferring and <i>distributing literary reputation</i>; "Very
likely; and in the present instance I think he has done
it so profusely as to have left none for himself."</p>

<p>Sir Philip Francis was the convivial companion of
Fox, and during the short administration of that statesman
was made a Knight of the Bath. One evening,
Roger Wilbraham came up to a whist-table at Brookes's,
where Sir Philip, who for the first time wore the ribbon
of the Order, was engaged in a rubber, and thus accosted
him. Laying hold of the ribbon and examining
it for some time, he said: "So, this is the way they
have rewarded you at last: they have given you a little
bit of red ribbon for your services, Sir Philip, have
they? A pretty bit of red ribbon to hang about your
neck; and that satisfies you, does it? Now, I wonder
what I shall have.&mdash;What do you think they will give
me, Sir Philip?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>The newly-made Knight, who had twenty-five guineas
depending on the rubber, and who was not very well
pleased at the interruption, suddenly turned round, and
looking at him fiercely, exclaimed, "A halter, and be <span class="nobreak">d&mdash;d</span>
to you!"</p>

<p>George III. invariably evinced a strong aversion to
Fox, the secret of which it is easy to understand. His
son, the Prince of Wales, threw himself into the arms of
Fox, and this in the most undisguised manner. Fox
lodged in St. James's-street, and as soon as he rose,
which was very late, had a levee of his followers, and of
the members of the gaming club, at Brookes's, all his disciples.
His bristly black person, and shagged breast quite
open, and rarely purified by any ablutions, was wrapped
in a foul linen night-gown, and his bushy hair dishevelled.
In these cynic weeds, and with epicurean good-humour,
did he dictate his politics, and in this school did the
heir of the Crown attend his lessons, and imbibe them.</p>

<p>Fox's love of play was desperate. A few evenings
before he moved the repeal of the Marriage Act, in
February, 1772, he had been at Brompton on two
errands: one to consult Justice Fielding on the penal
laws; the other to borrow ten thousand pounds, which
he brought to town at the hazard of being robbed. Fox
played admirably both at whist and piquet; with such
skill, indeed, that by the general admission of Brookes's
Club, he might have made four thousand pounds a year,
as they calculated, at those games, if he could have
confined himself to them. But his misfortune arose
from playing games at chance, particularly at Faro.
After eating and drinking plentifully, he sat down to the
Faro table, and inevitably rose a loser. Once, indeed,
and once only, he won about eight thousand pounds in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the course of a single evening. Part of the money he
paid away to his creditors, and the remainder he lost
almost immediately. Before he attained his thirtieth
year, he had completely dissipated everything that he
could either command, or could procure by the most
ruinous expedients. He had even undergone, at times,
many of the severest privations annexed to the vicissitudes
that mark a gamester's progress; frequently
wanting money to defray the common daily wants of
the most pressing nature. Topham Beauclerc, who lived
much in Fox's society, affirmed, that no man could form
an idea of the extremities to which he had been driven
in order to raise money, after losing his last guinea
at the Faro table. He was reduced for successive days
to such distress, as to borrow money from the waiters of
Brookes's. The very chairmen, whom he was unable to
pay, used to dun him for their arrears. In 1781, he
might be considered as an extinct volcano, for the
pecuniary aliment that had fed the flame was long consumed.
Yet he then occupied a house or lodgings in
St. James's-street close to Brookes's, where he passed
almost every hour which was not devoted to the House
of Commons. Brookes's was then the rallying point or
rendezvous of the Opposition; where, while faro, whist,
and supper prolonged the night, the principal members
of the Minority in both Houses met, in order to compare
their information, or to concert and mature their parliamentary
measures. Great sums were then borrowed of
Jews at exorbitant premiums. Fox called his outward
room, where the Jews waited till he rose, the <i>Jerusalem
Chamber</i>. His brother Stephen was enormously fat;
George Selwyn said he was in the right to deal with
Shylocks, as he could give them pounds of flesh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>When Fox lodged with his friend Fitzpatrick, at
Mackie's, some one remarked that two such inmates
would be the ruin of Mackie, the oilman; "No," said
George Selwyn; "so far from ruining him, they will
make poor Mackie's fortune; for he will have the credit
of having the finest pickles in London."</p>

<p>The ruling passion of Fox was partly owing to the lax
training of his father, who, by his lavish allowances,
fostered his propensity for play. According to Chesterfield,
the first Lord Holland "had no fixed principles in
religion or morality," and he censures him to his son for
being "too unwary in ridiculing and exposing them."
He gave full swing to Charles in his youth: "let nothing
be done," said his Lordship, "to break his spirit; the
world will do that for him." (<i>Selwyn.</i>) At his death, in
1774, he left him £154,000 to pay his debts; it was all
bespoke, and Fox soon became as deeply pledged as
before.</p>

<p>Walpole, in 1781, walking up St. James's-street, saw
a cart and porters at Fox's door; with copper and an
old chest of drawers, loading. His success at faro had
awakened a host of creditors; but, unless his bank had
swelled to the size of the Bank of England, it could not
have yielded a sou apiece for each. Epsom, too, had
been unpropitious; and one creditor had actually seized
and carried off Fox's goods, which did not seem worth
removing. Yet, shortly after this, whom should Walpole
find sauntering by his own door but Fox, who came up
and talked to him at the coach-window, on the Marriage
Bill, with as much <i>sang froid</i> as if he knew nothing of
what had happened.</p>

<p>It was at the sale of Fox's library in this year that
Walpole made the following singular note:&mdash;"1781,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
June 20. Sold by auction, the library of Charles Fox,
which had been taken in execution. Amongst the books
was Mr. Gibbon's first volume of 'Roman History,'
which appeared, by the title-page, to have been given by
the author to Mr. Fox, who had written in it the following
anecdote:&mdash;'The author at Brookes's said there was
no salvation for the country till six heads of the principal
persons in the administration were laid on the table;
eleven days later, the same gentleman accepted the place
of Lord of Trade under those very ministers, and has
acted with them ever since!' Such was the avidity of
bidders for the smallest production of so wonderful a
genius, that by the addition of this little record, the
book sold for three guineas."</p>

<p>Lord Tankerville assured Mr. Rogers that Fox once
played cards with Fitzpatrick at Brookes's from ten
o'clock at night till near six o'clock the next afternoon,
a waiter standing by to tell them "whose deal it was,"
they being too sleepy to know. Fox once won about
eight thousand pounds; and one of his bond-creditors,
who soon heard of his good luck, presented himself, and
asked for payment. "Impossible, Sir," replied Fox;
"I must first discharge my debts of honour."
The bond-creditor remonstrated. "Well, Sir, give me
your bond." It was delivered to Fox, who tore it in
pieces, and threw them into the fire. "Now, Sir," said
Fox, "my debt to you is a debt of honour;" and immediately
paid him.</p>

<p>Amidst the wildest excesses of youth, even while the
perpetual victim of his passion for play, Fox eagerly cultivated
at intervals his taste for letters, especially the
Greek and Roman historians and poets; and he found
resources in their works, under the most severe depressions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
occasioned by ill-success at the gaming-table. One
morning, after Fox had passed the whole night in company
with Topham Beauclerc at faro, the two friends
were about to separate. Fox had lost throughout the
night, and was in a frame of mind approaching desperation.
Beauclerc's anxiety for the consequences which
might ensue led him to be early at Fox's lodgings; and
on arriving, he inquired, not without apprehension,
whether he had risen. The servant replied that Mr.
Fox was in the drawing-room, when Beauclerc walked
upstairs, and cautiously opened the door, expecting to
behold a frantic gamester stretched on the floor, bewailing
his losses, or plunged in moody despair; but he was
astonished to find him reading a Greek Herodotus.
"What would you have me do?" said Fox, "I have
lost my last shilling." Upon other occasions, after
staking and losing all that he could raise at faro, instead
of exclaiming against fortune, or manifesting the
agitation natural under such circumstances, he would
lay his head on the table, and retain his place, but, exhausted
by mental and bodily fatigue, almost immediately
fall into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>One night, at Brookes's, Fox made some remark on
Government powder, in allusion to something that had
happened. Adams considered it a reflection, and sent
Fox a challenge. Fox went out, and took his station, giving
a full front. Fitzgerald said, "You must stand sideways."
Fox said, "Why I am as thick one way as the
other,"&mdash;"Fire," was given: Adams fired, Fox did not,
and when they said he must, he said, "I'll be <span class="nobreak">d&mdash;d</span> if I do.
I have no quarrel." They then advanced to shake hands.
Fox said, "Adams, you'd have killed me if it had not been
Government powder." The ball hit him in the groin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Another celebrated character, who frequented Brookes's
in the days of Selwyn, was Dunning, afterwards Lord
Ashburton; and many keen encounters passed between
them. Dunning was a short, thick man, with a turn-up
nose, a constant shake of the head, and latterly a distressing
hectic cough&mdash;but a wit of the first water.
Though he died at the comparatively early age of fifty-two,
he amassed a fortune of £150,000 during twenty-five
years' practice at the bar; and lived notwithstanding,
so liberally, that his mother, an attorney's widow,
some of the wags at Brookes's wickedly recorded, left
him in dudgeon on the score of his extravagance,
as humorously sketched at a dinner at the lawyer's
country-house near Fulham, when the following <i>conversation</i>
was represented to have occurred:&mdash;</p>

<p>"John," said the old lady to her son, after dinner,
during which she had been astounded by the profusion
of the plate and viands,&mdash;"John, I shall not stop another
day to witness such shameful extravagance."</p>

<p>"But, my dear mother," interrupted Dunning, "you
ought to consider that I can afford it: my income, you
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No income," said the old lady impatiently, "can
stand such shameful prodigality. The sum which your
cook told me that very <i>turbot</i> cost, ought to have supported
any reasonable family for a week."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! my dear mother," replied the dutiful
son, "you would not have me appear shabby. Besides,
what is a turbot?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! what is a turbot?" echoed the irritated
dame: "don't <i>pooh</i> me, John: I tell you such goings-on
can come to no good, and you'll see the end of it
before long. However, it sha'n't be said your mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
encouraged such sinful waste, for I'll set off in the coach
to Devonshire to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"And notwithstanding," said Sheridan, "all John's
rhetorical efforts to detain her, the old lady kept her
word."</p>

<p>Sheridan's election as a member of Brookes's took
place under conflicting circumstances. His success at
Stafford met with fewer obstacles than he had to encounter
in St. James's-street, where Selwyn's political
aversions and personal jealousy were very formidable,
as were those of the Earl of Bessborough, and
they and other members of the Club had determined
to exclude Sheridan. Conscious that every exertion
would be made to ensure his success, they agreed not to
absent themselves during the time allowed by the regulations
of the Club for ballots; and as one black ball
sufficed to extinguish the hopes of a candidate, they
repeatedly prevented his election. In order to remove
so serious an impediment, Sheridan had recourse to
artifice. On the evening when it was resolved to put
him up, he found his two inveterate enemies posted as
usual. A chairman was then sent with a note, written
in the name of her father-in-law, Lord Bessborough,
acquainting him that a fire had broken out in his house
in Cavendish Square, and entreating him immediately
to return home. Unsuspicious of any trick, as his son
and daughter-in-law lived under his roof, Lord Bessborough
unhesitatingly quitted the room, and got into
a sedan-chair. Selwyn, who resided not far from
Brookes's in Cleveland-row, received, nearly at the same
time, a verbal message to request his presence, in consequence
of Miss Fagniani, (whom he had adopted as
his daughter,) being suddenly seized with alarming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
indisposition. This summons he obeyed; and no sooner
was the room cleared, than Sheridan being proposed a
member, a ballot took place, when he was immediately
chosen. Lord Bessborough and Selwyn returned without
delay, on discovering the imposition that had been
practised on their credulity, but they were too late to
prevent its effects.</p>

<p>Such is the story told by Selwyn, in his Memoirs;
but the following account is more generally acredited.
The Prince of Wales joined Brookes's Club, to have
more frequent intercourse with Mr. Fox, one of its
earliest members, and who, on his first acquaintance
with Sheridan, became anxious for his admission to the
Club. Sheridan was three times proposed, but as often
had the black ball in the ballot, which disqualified him.
At length, the hostile ball was traced to George Selwyn,
who objected, because his (Sheridan's) father had been
upon the stage. Sheridan was apprised of this, and
desired that his name might be put up again, and that
the further conduct of the matter might be left to himself.
Accordingly, on the evening when he was to be balloted
for, Sheridan arrived at Brookes's arm-in-arm with the
Prince of Wales, just ten minutes before the balloting
began. They were shown into the candidates' waiting-room,
when one of the club-waiters was ordered to tell
Mr. Selwyn that the Prince desired to speak with him
immediately. Selwyn obeyed the summons, and Sheridan,
to whom this version of the affair states, Sheridan
had no personal dislike, entertained him for half-an-hour
with some political story, which interested him very
much, but had no foundation in truth. During Selwyn's
absence, the balloting went on, and Sheridan was chosen;
and the result was announced to himself and the Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
by the waiter, with the preconcerted signal of stroking
his chin with his hand. Sheridan immediately rose from
his seat, and apologizing for a few minutes' absence, told
Selwyn that "the Prince would finish the narrative, the
catastrophe of which he would find very remarkable."</p>

<p>Sheridan now went upstairs, was introduced to the
Club, and was soon in all his glory. The Prince, in
the meantime, had not the least idea of being left to
conclude a story, the thread of which (if it had a
thread) he had entirely forgotten. Still, by means of
Selwyn's occasional assistance, the Prince got on pretty
well for a few minutes, when a question from the listener
as to the flat contradiction of a part of His Royal
Highness' story to that of Sheridan, completely posed
the narrator, and he stuck fast. After much floundering,
the Prince burst into a loud laugh, saying, "<span class="nobreak">D&mdash;n</span>
the fellow, to leave me to finish the infernal story, of
which I know as much as a child unborn! But, never
mind, Selwyn; as Sheridan does not seem inclined to
come back, let me go upstairs, and I dare say Fox or
some of them will be able to tell you all about it." They
adjourned to the club room, and Selwyn now detected
the man&oelig;uvre. Sheridan then rose, made a low bow,
and apologized to Selwyn, through his dropping into
such good company, adding, "They have just been
making me a member without even <i>one black ball</i>, and
here I am." "The devil they have!" exclaimed Selwyn.&mdash;"Facts
speak for themselves," said Sheridan; "and I
thank you for your friendly suffrage; and now, if you will
sit down by us, I will finish my story."&mdash;"Your story!
it is all a lie from beginning to end," exclaimed Selwyn,
amidst loud laughter from all parts of the room.</p>

<p>Among the members who indulged in high play was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Alderman Combe, who is said to have made as much money
in this way as he did by brewing. One evening, whilst
he filled the office of Lord Mayor, he was busy at a full
hazard-table at Brookes's, where the wit and the dice-box
circulated together with great glee, and where Beau
Brummell was one of the party. "Come, Mashtub,"
said Brummell, who was the <i>caster</i>, "what do you
<i>set</i>?"&mdash;"Twenty-five guineas," answered the Alderman.&mdash;"Well,
then," returned the Beau, "have at the mare's
pony" (25 guineas). He continued to throw until he
drove home the brewer's twelve ponies, running; and
then, getting up, and making him a low bow, whilst
pocketing the cash, he said, "Thank you, alderman;
for the future, I shall never drink any porter but yours."&mdash;"I
wish, Sir," replied the brewer, "that every other
blackguard in London would tell me the same."</p>

<h2>"FIGHTING FITZGERALD"<br />
AT BROOKES'S.</h2>

<p>This notorious person, George Robert Fitzgerald,
though nearly related to one of the first families in
Ireland (Leinster), was executed in 1786, for a murder
which he had coolly premeditated, and had perpetrated
in a most cruel and cowardly manner.</p>

<p>His duelling propensities had kept him out of all the
first Clubs in London. He once applied to Admiral
Keith Stewart to propose him as a candidate for
Brookes's; when the Admiral, knowing that he must
either fight or comply with his request, chose the latter.
Accordingly, on the night when the ballot was to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
place (which was only a mere form in this case, for even
Keith Stewart had resolved to <i>black-ball</i> him), the
duellist accompanied the Admiral to St. James's-street,
and waited in the room below, while the ballot was
taken. This was soon done; for, without hesitation,
each member threw in a <i>black ball</i>; and when the
scrutiny came, the company were not a little amazed to
find not even <i>one</i> white ball among the number. However,
the rejection being carried <i>nem. con.</i>, the question
was, which of the members had the hardihood to announce
the result to the expectant candidate. No one
would undertake the office, for the announcement was
thought sure to produce a challenge; and a duel with
Fitzgerald had, in most cases, been fatal to his opponent.
The general opinion was that the proposer, Admiral
Stewart, should convey the intelligence. "No, gentlemen,"
said he, "I proposed the fellow because I knew
you would not admit him; but, by Jove, I have no inclination
to risk my life against that of a madman."</p>

<p>"But, Admiral," replied the Duke of Devonshire,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
"there being no <i>white ball</i> in the box, he must know
that <i>you</i> have black-balled him as well as the rest, and
he is sure to call you out at all events."</p>

<p>This posed the Admiral, who, after some hesitation,
proposed that the waiter should tell Fitzgerald that there
was <i>one</i> black ball, and that his name must be put up
again if he wished it. All concurred in the propriety
of this plan, and the waiter was dispatched on the
mission. In the meantime, Fitzgerald had frequently
rung the bell to inquire "the state of the poll," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
had sent each waiter to ascertain, but neither durst
return, when Mr. Brookes took the message from the
waiter who was descending the staircase, and boldly
entered the room, with a coffee equipage in his hand.
"Did you call for coffee, Sir?" said Mr. Brookes,
smartly. "<span class="nobreak">D&mdash;n</span> your coffee, Sir! and you too," answered
Mr. Fitzgerald, in a voice which made the host's
blood run cold. "I want to know, Sir, and that without
one moment's delay, Sir, if I am <i>chose</i> yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir!" replied Mr. Brookes, attempting to smile
away the appearance of fear, "I beg your pardon, Sir,
but I was just coming to announce to you, Sir, with
Admiral Stewart's compliments, Sir, that unfortunately
there was one black ball in the box, Sir; and consequently,
by the rules of the Club, Sir, no candidate can
be admitted without a new election, Sir;&mdash;which cannot
take place, by the standing regulations of the Club, Sir,
until one month from this time, Sir."</p>

<p>During this address, Fitzgerald's irascibility appeared
to undergo considerable mollification; and at its close,
he grasped Brookes's hand, saying, "My dear Brookes,
<i>I'm chose</i>; but there must be a small matter of mistake
in my election:" he then persuaded Brookes to go upstairs,
and make his compliments to the gentlemen, and
say, as it was only a mistake of <i>one</i> black ball, they
would be so good as to waive all ceremony on his account,
and proceed to <i>re-elect</i> their humble servant without
any more delay at all." Many of the members
were panic-struck, foreseeing a disagreeable finale to the
farce which they had been playing. Mr. Brookes stood
silent, waiting for the answer. At length, the Earl of
March (afterwards Duke of Queensberry) said aloud,
"Try the effect of <i>two</i> balls: <span class="nobreak">d&mdash;n</span> his Irish impudence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
if two balls don't take effect upon him, I don't know
what will." This proposition was agreed to, and Brookes
was ordered to communicate the same.</p>

<p>On re-entering the waiting-room, Mr. Fitzgerald
eagerly inquired, "Have they <i>elected</i> me right, now, Mr.
Brookes?" the reply was, "Sorry to inform you that the
result of the second balloting is&mdash;that <i>two</i> black balls were
dropped, Sir."&mdash;"Then," exclaimed Fitzgerald, "there's
now <i>two mistakes</i> instead of one." He then persuaded
Brookes again to proceed upstairs, and tell the honourable
members to "try again, and make no more mistakes."
General Fitzpatrick proposed that Brookes should reply,
"His cause was all hopeless, for that he was <i>black-balled
all over</i>, from head to foot, and it was hoped by
all the members that Mr. Fitzgerald would not persist in
thrusting himself into society where his company was
declined." This message was of no avail: no sooner had
Fitzgerald heard it than he exclaimed: "Oh, I perceive
it is a <i>mistake altogether</i>, Mr. Brookes, and I must see
to the rectifying of it myself, there's nothing like <i>daling</i>
with principals; so, I'll step up at once, and put this
thing to rights, without any more unnecessary delay."</p>

<p>In spite of Mr. Brookes's remonstrance, that his entrance
into the Club-room was against all rule and etiquette,
Fitzgerald flew upstairs, and entered the room
without any further ceremony than a bow, saying to the
members, who indignantly rose at the intrusion, "Your
servant, gentlemen&mdash;I beg ye will be <i>sated</i>."</p>

<p>Walking up to the fireplace, he thus addressed Admiral
Stewart:&mdash;"So, my dear Admiral, Mr. Brookes
informs me that I have been <i>elected</i> three times."</p>

<p>"You have been balloted for, Mr. Fitzgerald, but I am
sorry to say you have not been chosen," said Stewart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," replied the duellist, "did <i>you</i> black-ball
me?"&mdash;"My good Sir," answered the Admiral,
"how could you suppose such a thing?"&mdash;"Oh, I <i>supposed</i>
no such thing, my dear fellow; I only want to
know who it was that dropped the black balls in by accident,
as it were!"</p>

<p>Fitzgerald now went up to each individual member,
and put the same question <i>seriatim</i>, "Did you black-ball
me, Sir?" until he made the round of the whole Club;
and in each case he received a reply similar to that of
the Admiral. When he had finished his inquisition,
he thus addressed the whole body: "You see, Gentlemen,
that as none of ye have black-balled me, <i>I must be
chose</i>; and it is Mr. Brookes that has made the mistake.
But I was convinced of it from the beginning, and I am
only sorry that so much time has been lost as to prevent
honourable gentlemen from enjoying each other's company
sooner." He then desired the waiter to bring
him a bottle of champagne, that he might drink long life
to the Club, and wish them joy of their unanimous election
of a "<i>rael</i> gentleman by father and mother, and <i>who
never missed his man</i>."</p>

<p>The members now saw that there was nothing to be
done but to send the intruder to Coventry, which they
appeared to do by tacit agreement; for when Admiral
Stewart departed, Mr. Fitzgerald found himself <i>cut</i> by
all his "dear friends." The members now formed parties
at the whist-table; and no one replied to Fitzgerald's
observations nor returned even a nod to the toasts and
healths which he drank in three bottles of champagne,
which the terrified waiter placed before him, in succession.
At length, he arose, made a low bow, and took
leave, promising to "come earlier next night, and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
a little more of it." It was then agreed that half-a-dozen
stout constables should be in waiting the next
evening to bear him off to the watch-house, if he attempted
again to intrude. Of this measure, Fitzgerald
seemed to be aware; for he never again showed himself
at Brookes's; though he boasted everywhere that he had
been unanimously chosen a member of the Club.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>ARTHUR'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>This Club, established more than a century since, at
No. 69, St. James's-street, derives its name from Mr.
Arthur, the master of White's Chocolate-house in the
same street. Mr. Cunningham records: "Arthur died
in June, 1761, in St. James's-place; and in the following
October, Mr. Mackreth married Arthur's only child,
and Arthur's Chocolate-house, as it was then called,
became the property of this Mr. Mackreth."</p>

<p>Walpole, writing in 1759, has this odd note: "I
stared to-day at Piccadilly like a country squire; there
are twenty new stone houses: at first I concluded that
all the grooms that used to live there, had got estates
and built palaces. One young gentleman, who was getting
an estate, but was so indiscreet as to step out of his
way to rob a comrade, is convicted, and to be transported;
in short, one of the waiters at Arthur's. George
Selwyn says, 'What a horrid idea he will give us of the
people in Newgate?'"</p>

<p>Mackreth prospered; for Walpole, writing to Mann,
in 1774, speaking of the New Parliament, says: "Bob,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
formerly a waiter at White's, was set up by my nephew
for two boroughs, and actually is returned for Castle
Rising with Mr. Wedderburne;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"'Servus curru portatur eodem;'</p>
</div>

<p>which I suppose will offend the Scottish Consul, as most
of his countrymen resent an Irishman standing for Westminster,
which the former reckon a borough of their
own. For my part, waiter for waiter, I see little difference;
they were all equally ready to cry, 'Coming,
coming, Sir.'"</p>

<p>Mackreth was afterwards knighted; and upon him appeared
this smart and well-remembered epigram:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When Mackreth served in Arthur's crew,</p>
<p>He said to Rumbold, 'Black my shoe;'</p>
<p class="i1">To which he answer'd, 'Ay, Bob.'</p>
<p>But when return'd from India's land,</p>
<p>And grown too proud to brook command,</p>
<p class="i1">He sternly answer'd, 'Nay, Bob.'"</p>

<p>The Club-house was rebuilt in 1825, upon the site of
the original Chocolate-house, Thomas Hopper, architect,
at which time it possessed more than average design:
the front is of stone, and is enriched with fluted Corinthian
columns.</p>

<h2>WHITE'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>This celebrated Club was originally established as
"White's Chocolate-house," in 1698, five doors from the
bottom of the west side of St. James's-street, "ascending
from St. James's Palace." (Hatton, 1708.) A print
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of the time shows a small garden attached to the house:
at the tables in the house or garden, more than one highwayman
took his chocolate, or threw his main, before he
quietly mounted his horse, and rode down Piccadilly
towards Bagshot. (Doran's <i>Table Traits</i>.) It was
destroyed by fire, April 28, 1733, when the house was
kept by Mr. Arthur, who subsequently gave his name to
the Club called Arthur's, still existing a few doors above
the original White's. At the fire, young Arthur's wife
leaped out of a second floor window, upon a feather-bed,
without much hurt. A fine collection of paintings, belonging
to Sir Andrew Fountaine, valued at 3000<i>l.</i>, was
entirely destroyed. The King and the Prince of Wales
were present above an hour, and encouraged the firemen
and people to work at the engines; a guard being ordered
from St. James's, to keep off the populace. His
Majesty ordered twenty guineas to be distributed among
the firemen and others that worked at the engines, and
five guineas to the guard; and the Prince ordered the
firemen ten guineas. "The incident of the fire," says
Mr. Cunningham, "was made use of by Hogarth, in
Plate VI. of the Rake's Progress, representing a room
at White's. The total abstraction of the gamblers is
well expressed by their utter inattention to the alarm of
the fire given by watchmen, who are bursting open the
doors. Plate IV. of the same pictured moral represents
a group of chimney-sweepers and shoe-blacks gambling
on the ground over-against White's. To indicate
the Club more fully, Hogarth has inserted the name
Black's."</p>

<p>Arthur, thus burnt out, removed to Gaunt's Coffee-house,
next the St. James's Coffee-house, and which
bore the name of "White's"&mdash;a myth. The <i>Tatler</i>, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
his first Number, promises that "all accounts of gallantry,
pleasure, and entertainment, shall be under the
article of White's Chocolate-house." Addison, in his
Prologue to Steele's <i>Tender Husband</i>, catches "the necessary
spark" sometimes "taking snuff at White's."</p>

<p>The Chocolate-house, open to any one, became a private
Club-house: the earliest record is a book of rules
and list of members of the old Club at White's, dated
October 30th, 1736. The principal members were the
Duke of Devonshire; the Earls of Cholmondeley, Chesterfield,
and Rockingham; Sir John Cope, Major-General
Churchill, Bubb Dodington, and Colley Cibber.
Walpole tells us that the celebrated Earl of Chesterfield
lived at White's, gaming and pronouncing witticisms
among the boys of quality; "yet he says to his son,
that a member of a gaming club should be a cheat, or
he will soon be a beggar," an inconsistency which reminds
one of old Fuller's saw: "A father that whipt
his son for swearing, and swore himself whilst he whipt
him, did more harm by his example than good by his
correction."</p>

<p>Swift, in his <i>Essay on Modern Education</i>, gives the
Chocolate-house a sad name. "I have heard," he says,
"that the late Earl of Oxford, in the time of his ministry,
never passed by White's Chocolate-house (the
common rendezvous of infamous sharpers and noble
cullies) without bestowing a curse upon that famous
Academy, as the bane of half the English nobility."</p>

<p>The gambling character of the Club may also be gathered
from Lord Lyttelton writing to Dr. Doddridge,
in 1750. "The Dryads of Hagley are at present pretty
secure, but I tremble to think that the rattling of a
dice-box at White's may one day or other (if my son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
should be a member of that noble academy) shake down
all our fine oaks. It is dreadful to see, not only there,
but almost in every house in town, what devastations
are made by that destructive fury, the spirit of play."</p>

<p>Swift's character of the company is also borne out by
Walpole, in a letter to Mann, December 16, 1748:
"There is a man about town, Sir William Burdett, a
man of very good family, but most infamous character.
In short, to give you his character at once, there is a
wager entered in the bet-book at White's (a MS. of
which I may one day or other give you an account),
that the first baronet that will be hanged is this Sir
William Burdett."</p>

<p>Again, Glover, the poet, in his <i>Autobiography</i>, tells
us: "Mr. Pelham (the Prime Minister) was originally
an officer in the army, and a professed gamester; of a
narrow mind, low parts, etc.... By long experience
and attendance he became experienced as a Parliament
man; and even when Minister, divided his time to the
last between his office and the club of gamesters at
White's." And, Pope, in the <i>Dunciad</i>, has:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Or chair'd at White's, amidst the doctors sit,</p>
<p>Teach oaths to gamesters, and to nobles wit."</p>
</div>

<p>The Club removed, in 1755, to the east side of St.
James's-street, No. 38. The house had had previously
a noble and stately tenant; for here resided the Countess
of Northumberland, widow of Algernon, tenth
Earl of Northumberland, who died 1688. "My friend
Lady Suffolk, her niece by marriage," writes Walpole,
"has talked to me of her having, on that alliance, visited
her. She then lived in the house now White's, at
the upper end of St. James's-street, and was the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
who kept up the ceremonious state of the old peerage.
When she went out to visit, a footman, bareheaded,
walked on each side of her coach, and a second coach
with her women attended her. I think, too, that Lady
Suffolk told me that her granddaughter-in-law, the Duchess
of Somerset, never sat down before her without
leave to do so. I suppose the old Duke Charles [the
proud Duke] had imbibed a good quantity of his stately
pride in such a school." (<i>Letter to the Bishop of Dromore</i>,
September 18, 1792.) This high-minded dame
had published a "Volume of Prayers."</p>

<p>Among the Rules of the Club, every member was to
pay one guinea a year towards having a good cook;
the names of all candidates were to be deposited with
Mr. Arthur or Bob [Mackreth]. In balloting, every
member was to put in his ball, and such person or persons
who refuse to comply with it, shall pay the supper
reckoning of that night; and, in 1769, it was agreed
that 'every member of this Club who is in the Billiard-Room
at the time the Supper is declared upon table,
shall pay his reckoning if he does not sup at the Young
Club.'</p>

<p>Of Colley Cibber's membership we find this odd account
in Davies's <i>Life of Garrick</i>:&mdash;"Colley, we told,
had the honour to be a member of the great Club at
White's; and so I suppose might any other man who
wore good clothes and paid his money when he lost it.
But on what terms did Cibber live with this society?
Why, he feasted most sumptuously, as I have heard his
friend Victor say, with an air of triumphant exultation,
with Mr. Arthur and his wife, and gave a trifle for his
dinner. After he had dined, when the Club-room door
was opened, and the Laureate was introduced, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
saluted with loud and joyous acclamation of 'O King
Coll! Come in, King Coll!' and 'Welcome, welcome,
King Colley!' And this kind of gratulation, Mr. Victor
thought, was very gracious and very honourable."</p>

<p>In the Rules quoted by Mr. Cunningham, from the
Club-books, we find that in 1780, a dinner was ready
every day during the sitting of Parliament, at a reckoning
of 12<i>s.</i> per head; in 1797, at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per head,
malt liquors, biscuits, oranges, apples, and olives included;
hot suppers provided at 8<i>s.</i> per head; and cold
meat, oysters, etc., at 4<i>s.</i>, malt liquor only included.
And, "that Every Member who plays at Chess, Draughts,
or Backgammon do pay One Shilling each time of playing
by daylight, and half-a-crown each by candlelight."</p>

<p>White's was from the beginning principally a gaming
Club. The play was mostly at hazard and faro; no
member was to hold a faro Bank. Whist was comparatively
harmless. Professional gamblers, who lived
by dice and cards, provided they were free from the imputation
of cheating, procured admission to White's. It
was a great supper-house, and there was play before and
after supper, carried on to a late hour and heavy amounts.
Lord Carlisle lost 10,000<i>l.</i> in one night, and was in debt
to the house for the whole. He tells Selwyn of a set,
in which at one point of the game, stood to win 50,000<i>l.</i>
Sir John Bland, of Kippax Park, who shot himself in
1755, as we learn from Walpole, flirted away his whole
fortune at hazard. "He t'other night exceeded what
was lost by the late Duke of Bedford, having at one
period of the night, (though he recovered the greater
part of it,) lost two-and-thirty thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Lord Mountford came to a tragic end through his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
gambling. He had lost money; feared to be reduced
to distress; asked for a Government appointment, and
determined to throw the die of life or death, on the
answer he received from Court. The answer was unfavourable.
He consulted several persons, indirectly at
first, afterwards pretty directly&mdash;on the easiest mode of
finishing life; invited a dinner-party for the day after;
supped at White's, and played at whist till one o'clock
of the New Year's morning. Lord Robert Bertie drank
to him "a happy new year;" he clapped his hand
strangely to his eyes. In the morning, he sent for a
lawyer and three witnesses, executed his will; made them
read it twice over, paragraph by paragraph; asked the
lawyer if that will would stand good though a man were
to shoot himself. Being assured it would, he said,
"Pray stay, while I step into the next room,"&mdash;went into
the next room, and shot himself.</p>

<p>Walpole writes to Mann: "John Damier and his two
brothers have contracted a debt, one can scarcely expect
to be believed out of England,&mdash;of 70,000<i>l.</i>...
The young men of this age seem to make a law among
themselves for declaring their fathers superannuated
at fifty, and thus dispose of their estates as if already
their own." "Can you believe that Lord Foley's two
sons have borrowed money so extravagantly, that the
interest they have contracted to pay, amounts to 18,000<i>l.</i>
a year."</p>

<p>Fox's love of play was frightful: his best friends are
said to have been half-ruined in annuities, given by them
as securities for him to the Jews. Five hundred thousand
a year of such annuities, of Fox and his Society,
were advertised to be sold, at one time: Walpole wondered
what Fox would do when he had sold the estates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of all his friends. Here are some instances of his
desperate play. Walpole further notes that in the debate
on the Thirty-nine Articles, February 6, 1772, Fox
did not shine, "nor could it be wondered at. He had
sat up playing at hazard at Almack's, from Tuesday
evening the 4th, till five in the afternoon of Wednesday,
5th. An hour before he had recovered 12,000<i>l.</i> that he
had lost, and by dinner, which was at five o'clock, he had
ended losing 11,000<i>l.</i> On the Thursday, he spoke in the
above debate; went to dinner at past eleven at night;
from thence to White's, where he drank till seven the
next morning; thence to Almack's, where he won 6,000<i>l.</i>;
and between three and four in the afternoon he set out
for Newmarket. His brother Stephen lost 11,000<i>l.</i> two
nights after, and Charles 10,000<i>l.</i> more on the 13th; so
that, in three nights, the two brothers, the eldest not
twenty-five, lost 32,000<i>l.</i>"</p>

<p>Walpole and a party of friends, (Dick Edgecumbe,
George Selwyn, and Williams,) in 1756, composed a
piece of heraldic satire&mdash;a coat-of-arms for the two
gaming-clubs at White's,&mdash;which was "actually engraving
from a very pretty painting of Edgecumbe, whom
Mr. Chute, as Strawberry King at arms," appointed their
chief herald-painter. The blazon is vert (for a card-table);
three parolis proper on a chevron sable (for a
hazard-table); two rouleaux in saltire between two dice
proper, on a canton sable; a white ball (for election)
argent. The supporters are an old and young knave of
clubs; the crest, an arm out of an earl's coronet shaking
a dice-box; and the motto, "Cogit amor nummi."
Round the arms is a claret-bottle ticket by way of order.
The painting above mentioned by Walpole of "the Old
and Young Club at Arthur's" was bought at the sale of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Strawberry Hill by Arthur's Club-house for twenty-two
shillings.</p>

<p>At White's, the least difference of opinion invariably
ended in a bet, and a book for entering the particulars
of all bets was always laid upon the table; one of these,
with entries of a date as early as 1744, Mr. Cunningham
tells us, had been preserved. A book for entering bets
is still laid on the table.</p>

<p>In these betting books are to be found bets on births,
deaths, and marriages; the length of a life, or the duration
of a ministry; a placeman's prospect of a coronet;
on the shock of an earthquake; or the last scandal
at Ranelagh, or Madame Cornelys's. A man dropped
down at the door of White's; he was carried into the
house. Was he dead or not? The odds were immediately
given and taken for and against. It was proposed
to bleed him. Those who had taken the odds the man
was dead, protested that the use of a lancet would affect
the fairness of the bet.</p>

<p>Walpole gives some of these narratives as good stories
"made on White's." A parson coming into the Club
on the morning of the earthquake of 1750, and hearing
bets laid whether the shock was caused by an earthquake
or the blowing-up of powder-mills, went away in horror,
protesting they were such an impious set, that he believed
if the last trump were to sound, they would bet
"puppet-show against Judgment." Gilly Williams writes
to Selwyn, 1764, "Lord Digby is very soon to be married
to Miss Fielding." Thousands might have been
won in this house (White's), on his Lordship not knowing
that such a being existed.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham tells us that "the marriage of a
young lady of rank would occasion a bet of a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
guineas, that she would give birth to a live child before
the Countess of &mdash;&mdash;, who had been married three or
even more months before her. Heavy bets were pending,
that Arthur, who was then a widower, would be married
before a member of the Club of about the same age,
and also a widower; and that Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough,
would outlive the old Duchess of Cleveland."</p>

<p>"One of the youth at White's," writes Walpole to
Mann, July 10, 1744, "has committed a murder, and
intends to repeat it. He betted £1500 that a man
could live twelve hours under water; hired a desperate
fellow, sunk him in a ship, by way of experiment, and
both ship and man have not appeared since. Another
man and ship are to be tried for their lives, instead of
Mr. Blake, the assassin."</p>

<p>Walpole found at White's, a very remarkable entry in
their very&mdash;very remarkable wager-book, which is still
preserved. "Lord Mountford bets Sir John Bland
twenty guineas that Nash outlives Cibber." "How odd,"
says Walpole, "that these two old creatures, selected for
their antiquities, should live to see both their wagerers
put an end to their own lives! Cibber is within a few
days of eighty-four, still hearty, and clear, and well.
I told him I was glad to see him look so well. 'Faith,'
said he, 'it is very well that I look at all.'" Lord
Mountford would have been the winner: Cibber died
in 1757; Nash in 1761.</p>

<p>Here is a nice piece of Selwyn's ready wit. He and
Charles Townshend had a kind of wit combat together.
Selwyn, it is said, prevailed; and Charles Townshend
took the wit home in his carriage, and dropped him
at White's. "Remember," said Selwyn, as they parted,
"this is the first set-down you have given me to-day."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"St. Leger," says Walpole, "was at the head of these
luxurious heroes&mdash;he is the hero of all fashion. I never
saw more dashing vivacity and absurdity with some
flashes of parts. He had a cause the other day for ducking
a sharper, and was going to swear; the judge said to
him, 'I see, Sir, you are very ready to take an oath.'
'Yes, my Lord,' replied St. Leger, 'my father was a
judge,'" St. Leger was a lively club member. "Rigby,"
writes the Duke of Bedford, July 2, 1751, "the town
is grown extremely thin within this week, though White's
continues numerous enough, with young people only, for
Mr. St. Leger's vivacity, and the idea the old ones have
of it, prevent the great chairs at the Old Club from being
filled with their proper drowsy proprietors."</p>

<p>In Hogarth's gambling scene at White's, we see the
highwayman, with the pistols peeping out of his pocket,
waiting by the fireside till the heaviest winner takes his
departure, in order to "recoup" himself of his losings.
And in the <i>Beaux' Stratagem</i>, Aimwell asks of Gibbet,
"Ha'n't I seen your face at White's?"&mdash;"Ay, and at
Will's too," is the highwayman's answer.</p>

<p>M'Clean, the fashionable highwayman, had a lodging
in St. James's-street, over-against White's; and he was
as well known about St. James's as any gentleman who
lived in that quarter, and who, perhaps, went upon the
road too. When M'Clean was taken, in 1750, Walpole
tells us that Lord Mountford, at the head of half White's,
went the first day; his aunt was crying over him; as
soon as they were withdrawn, she said to him, knowing
they were of White's, "My dear, what did the Lords say
to you? Have you ever been concerned with any of them?
Was it not admirable? What a favourable idea people
must have of White's!&mdash;and what if White's should not
deserve a much better?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>A waitership at a club sometimes led to fortune. Thomas
Rumbold, originally a waiter at White's, got an appointment
in India, and suddenly rose to be Sir Thomas,
and Governor of Madras. On his return, with immense
wealth, a bill of pains and penalties was brought into the
House by Dundas, with the view of stripping Sir Robert
of his ill-gotten gains. This bill was briskly pushed
through the earlier stages; suddenly the proceedings
were arrested by adjournment, and the measure fell to
the ground. The rumour of the day attributed Rumbold's
escape to the corrupt assistance of Rigby; who,
in 1782, found himself, by Lord North's retirement, deprived
of his place in the Pay Office, and called upon to
refund a large amount of public moneys unaccounted
for. In this strait, Rigby was believed to have had recourse
to Rumbold. Their acquaintance had commenced
in earlier days, when Rigby was one of the boldest "punters"
at White's, and Rumbold bowed to him for half-crowns.
Rumbold is said to have given Rigby a large
sum of money, on condition of the former being released
from the impending pains and penalties. The truth of
this report has been vehemently denied; but the circumstances
are suspicious. The bill was dropped: Dundas,
its introducer, was Rigby's intimate associate.
Rigby's nephew and heir soon after married Rumbold's
daughter. Sir Thomas himself had married a daughter
of Dr. Law, Bishop of Carlisle. The worthy Bishop
stood godfather to one of Rumbold's children; the other
godfather was the Nabob of Arcot, and the child was
christened "Mahomet." So, at least, Walpole informs
Mann.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Rigby was a man of pleasure at White's. Wilkes, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the <i>North Briton</i>, describes Rigby as "an excellent <i>bon-vivant</i>,
amiable and engaging; having all the gibes and
gambols, and flashes of merriment, which set the table in
a roar." In a letter to Selwyn, Rigby writes: "I am just
got home from a cock-match, where I have won forty
pounds in ready money; and not having dined, am waiting
till I hear the rattle of the coaches from the House
of Commons, in order to dine at White's.... The next
morning I heard there had been extreme deep play, and
that Harry Furnese went drunk from White's at six
o'clock, and with the ever memorable sum of 1000
guineas. He won the chief part of Doneraile and Bob
Bertie."</p>

<p>The Club has had freaks of epicurism. In 1751, seven
young men of fashion, headed by St. Leger, gave a dinner
at White's: one dish was a tart of choice cherries
from a hot-house; only one glass was tasted out of each
bottle of champagne. "The bill of fare is got into print,"
writes Walpole, to Mann; "and with good people has
produced the apprehension of another earthquake."</p>

<p>From Mackreth the property passed in 1784, to John
Martindale, and in 1812, to Mr. Raggett, the father of
the present proprietor. The original form of the house
was designed by James Wyatt. From time to time,
White's underwent various alterations and additions. In
the autumn of 1850, certain improvements being thought
necessary, it came to be considered that the front was of
too plain a character, when contrasted with the many
elegant buildings which had risen up around it. Mr.
Lockyer was consulted by Mr. Raggett as to the possibility
of improving the façade; and under his direction,
four bas-reliefs, representing the four seasons, which occupy
the place of four sashes, were designed by Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
George Scharf, jun. The interior was redecorated by
Mr. Morant. The Club, which is at this time limited
to 500 members, was formerly composed of the high
Tory party, but though Conservative principles may probably
prevail, it has now ceased to be a political club,
and may rather be termed "Aristocratic." Several of
the present members have belonged to the Club upwards
of half a century, and the ancestors of most of the noblemen
and men of fashion of the present day who belong
to the club were formerly members of it.</p>

<p>The Club has given magnificent entertainments in our
time. On June 20, 1814, they gave a ball at Burlington
House to the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia,
and the allied sovereigns then in England; the cost
was 9849<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Three weeks after this, the Club
gave to the Duke of Wellington a dinner, which cost
2480<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>BOODLE'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>This Club, originally the "Savoir vivre," which with
Brookes's and White's, forms a trio of nearly coeval date,
and each of which takes the present name of its founder,
is No. 28, St. James's-street. In its early records it
was noted for its costly gaieties, and the <i>Heroic Epistle
to Sir William Chambers</i>, 1773, commemorates its epicurism:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"For what is Nature? Ring her changes round,</p>
<p>Her three flat notes are water, plants, and ground;</p>
<p>Prolong the peal, yet, spite of all your clatter,</p>
<p>The tedious chime is still ground, plants, and water;</p>
<p>So, when some John his dull invention racks,</p>
<p>To rival Boodle's dinners or Almack's,</p>
<p>Three uncouth legs of mutton shock our eyes,</p>
<p>Three roasted geese, three buttered apple-pies."</p>
</div>

<p>In the following year, when the Clubs vied with each
other in giving the town the most expensive masquerades
and ridottos, Gibbon speaks of one given by the members
of Boodle's, that cost 2000 guineas. Gibbon was early
of the Club; and, "it must be remembered, waddled as
well as warbled here when he exhibited that extraordinary
person which is said to have convulsed Lady Sheffield
with laughter; and poured forth accents mellifluous
like Plato's from that still more extraordinary mouth
which has been described as 'a round hole' in the centre
of his face."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Boodle's Club-house, designed by Holland, has long
been eclipsed by the more pretentious architecture of the
Club edifices of our time; but the interior arrangements
are well planned. Boodle's is chiefly frequented by
country gentlemen, whose status has been thus satirically
insinuated by a contemporary: "Every Sir John belongs
to Boodle's&mdash;as you may see, for, when a waiter comes
into the room and says to some aged student of the <i>Morning
Herald</i>, 'Sir John, your servant is come,' every head
is mechanically thrown up in answer to the address.'"</p>

<p>Among the Club pictures are portraits of C. J. Fox, and
the Duke of Devonshire. Next door, at No. 29, resided
Gillray, the caricaturist, who, in 1815, threw himself
from an upstairs window into the street, and died in
consequence.</p>

<h2>THE BEEF-STEAK SOCIETY.</h2>

<p>In the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 9, March 10, 1710-11, we read:
"The Beef-steak and October Clubs are neither of them
averse to eating or drinking, if we may form a judgment
of them from their respective titles." This passage refers
to the Beef-steak Club, founded in the reign of
Queen Anne; and, it is believed, the earliest Club with
that name. Dr. King, in his <i>Art of Cookery</i>, humbly
<i>inscribed to the Beef-steak Club</i>, 1709, has these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"He that of honour, wit, and mirth partakes,</p>
<p>May be a fit companion o'er Beef-steaks:</p>
<p>His name may be to future times enrolled</p>
<p>In Estcourt's book, whose gridiron's framed with gold."</p>
</div>

<p>Estcourt, the actor, was made Providore of the Club;
and for a mark of distinction wore their badge, which
was a small gridiron of gold, hung about his neck with a
green silk ribbon. Such is the account given by Chetwood,
in his <i>History of the Stage</i>, 1749; to which he
adds: "this Club was composed of the chief wits and
great men of the nation." The gridiron, it will be
seen hereafter, was assumed as its badge, by the "Society
of Beef-steaks, established a few years later: they call
themselves 'the Steaks,' and abhor the notion of being
thought a Club." Though the <i>National Review</i>, heretical
as it may appear, cannot consent to dissever the Society
from the earlier Beef-steak Club; which, however, would
imply that Rich and Lambert were not the founders of
the Society, although so circumstantially shown to be.
Still, the stubbornness of facts must prevail.</p>

<p>Dick Estcourt was beloved by Steele, who thus introduces
him in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 358: "The best man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
that I know of for heightening the real gaiety of a company
is Estcourt, whose jovial humour diffuses itself from
the highest person at an entertainment to the meanest
waiter. Merry tales, accompanied with apt gestures and
lively representations of circumstances and persons, beguile
the gravest mind into a consent to be as humorous
as himself. Add to this, that when a man is in his
good graces, he has a mimicry that does not debase the
person he represents, but which, taken from the gravity
of the character, adds to the agreeableness of it."</p>

<p>Then, in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 264, we find a letter from
Sir Roger de Coverley, from Coverley, "To Mr. Estcourt,
at his House in Covent Garden," addressing him as "Old
Comical One," and acknowledging "the hogsheads of
neat port came safe," and hoping next term to help fill
Estcourt's Bumper "with our people of the Club." The
Bumper was the tavern in Covent Garden, which Estcourt
opened about a year before his death. In this quality
Parnell speaks of him in the beginning of one of his
poems:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Gay Bacchus liking Estcourt's wine</p>
<p class="i1">A noble meal bespoke us,</p>
<p>And for the guests that were to dine</p>
<p class="i1">Brought Comus, Love, and Jocus."</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Spectator</i> delivers this merited eulogy of the player,
just prior to his benefit at the theatre: "This pleasant
fellow gives one some idea of the ancient Pantomime,
who is said to have given the audience in dumb-show, an
exact idea of any character or passion, or an intelligible
relation of any public occurrence, with no other expression
than that of his looks and gestures. If all who have
been obliged to these talents in Estcourt will be at <i>Love
for Love</i> to-morrow night, they will but pay him what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
they owe him, at so easy a rate as being present at a
play which nobody would omit seeing, that had, or had
not, ever seen it before."</p>

<p>Then, in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 468, August 27, 1712, with
what touching pathos does Steele record the last exit of
this choice spirit: "I am very sorry that I have at present
a circumstance before me which is of very great importance
to all who have a relish for gaiety, wit, mirth,
or humour: I mean the death of poor Dick Estcourt. I
have been obliged to him for so many hours of jollity,
that it is but a small recompense, though all I can give
him, to pass a moment or two in sadness for the loss of
so agreeable a man.... Poor Estcourt! Let the vain
and proud be at rest, thou wilt no more disturb their
admiration of their dear selves; and thou art no longer
to drudge in raising the mirth of stupids, who know
nothing of thy merit, for thy maintenance." Having
spoken of him "as a companion and a man qualified for
conversation,"&mdash;his fortune exposing him to an obsequiousness
towards the worst sort of company, but his
excellent qualities rendering him capable of making the
best figure in the most refined, and then having told
of his maintaining "his good humour with a countenance
or a language so delightful, without offence to any
person or thing upon earth, still preserving the distance
his circumstances obliged him to,"&mdash;Steele concludes
with, "I say, I have seen him do all this in such a
charming manner, that I am sure none of those I hint
at will read this, without giving him some sorrow for
their abundant mirth, and one gush of tears for so many
bursts of laughter. I wish it were any honour to the
pleasant creature's memory, that my eyes are too much
suffused to let me go on&mdash;&mdash;" We agree with Leigh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Hunt that Steele's "overfineness of nature was never
more beautifully evinced in any part of his writings than
in this testimony to the merits of poor Dick Estcourt."</p>

<p>Ned Ward, in his <i>Secret History of Clubs</i>, first edition,
1709, describes the Beef-steaks, which he coarsely
contrasts with "the refined wits of the Kit-Cat." This
new Society griliado'd beef eaters first settled their
meeting at the sign of the Imperial Phiz, just opposite
to a famous conventicle in the Old Jury, a publick-house
that has been long eminent for the true British quintessence
of malt and hops, and a broiled sliver off the
juicy rump of a fat, well-fed bullock.... This noted
boozing ken, above all others in the City, was chosen
out by the Rump-steak admirers, as the fittest mansion
to entertain the Society, and to gratify their appetites
with that particular dainty they desired to be distinguished
by. [The Club met at the place appointed, and
chose for a Prolocutor, an Irish comedian.] No sooner
had they confirmed their Hibernian mimic in his honourable
post, but to distinguish him from the rest, they
made him a Knight of St. Lawrence, and hung a silver (?)
gridiron about his neck, as a badge of the dignity they
had conferred upon him, that when he sung <i>Pretty Parrot</i>,
he might thrum upon the bars of his new instrument,
and mimic a haughty Spaniard serenading his
Donna with guitar and madrigal. The Zany, as proud
of his new fangle as a German mountebank of a prince's
medal, when he was thus dignified and distinguished
with his culinary symbol hanging before his breast, took
the highest post of honour, as his place at the board,
where, as soon as seated, there was not a bar in the silver
kitchen-stuff that the Society had presented him with,
but was presently handled with a theatrical pun, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
an Irish witticism.... Orders were dispatched to the
superintendent of the kitchen to provide several nice
specimens of their Beef-steak cookery, some with the
flavour of a shalot or onion; some broil'd, some fry'd,
some stew'd, some toasted, and others roasted, that every
judicious member of the new erected Club might appeal
to his palate, and from thence determine whether the
house they had chosen for their rendezvous truly deserved
that public fame for their inimitable management
of a bovinary sliver, which the world had given them....
When they had moderately supplied their beef stomachs,
they were all highly satisfy'd with the choice they had
made, and from that time resolved to repeat their meeting
once a week in the same place." At the next
meeting the constitution and bye-laws of the new little
commonwealth were settled; and for the further encouragement
of wit and pleasantry throughout the whole
Society, there was provided a very voluminous paper
book, "about as thick as a bale of Dutch linen, into
which were to be entered every witty saying that should
be spoke in the Society:" this nearly proved a failure;
but Ward gives a taste of the performances by reciting
some that had been stolen out of their Journal by a false
Brother; here is one:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ON AN OX.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Most noble creature of the horned race,</p>
<p>Who labours at the plough to earn thy grass,</p>
<p>And yielding to the yoke, shows man the way</p>
<p>To bear his servile chains, and to obey</p>
<p>More haughty tyrants, who usurp the sway.</p>
<p>Thy sturdy sinews till the farmer's grounds,</p>
<p>To thee the grazier owes his hoarded pounds:</p>
<p>'Tis by thy labour, we abound in malt,</p>
<p>Whose powerful juice the meaner slaves exalt;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>
<p>And when grown fat, and fit to be devour'd,</p>
<p>The pole-ax frees thee from the teazing goard:</p>
<p>Thus cruel man, to recompense thy pains,</p>
<p>First works thee hard, and then beats out thy brains."</p>
</div>

<p>Ward is very hard upon the Kit-Cat community, and
tells us that the Beef-steaks, "like true Britons, to show
their resentment in contempt of Kit-Cat pies, very justly
gave the preference to a rump-steak, most wisely agreeing
that the venerable word, beef, gave a more masculine
grace, and sounded better in the title of a true English
Club, than either Pies or Kit-Cat; and that a gridiron,
which has the honour to be made the badge of a Saint's
martyrdom, was a nobler symbol of their Christian integrity,
than two or three stars or garters; who learnedly
recollecting how great an affinity the word bull has
to beef, they thought it very consistent with the constitution
of their Society, instead of a Welsh to have a
Hibernian secretary. Being thus fixed to the great
honour of a little alehouse, next door to the Church, and
opposite to the Meeting, they continued to meet for some
time; till their fame spreading over all the town, and
reaching the ears of the great boys and little boys, as
they came in the evening from Merchant Taylors' School,
they could not forbear hollowing as they passed the door;
and being acquainted with their nights of meeting, they
seldom failed, when the divan was sitting, of complimenting
their ears with 'Huzza! Beef-steak!'&mdash;that
they might know from thence, how much they were reverenced
for men of learning by the very school-boys."</p>

<p>"But the modest Club," says Ward, "not affecting
popularity, and choosing rather to be deaf to all public
flatteries, thought it an act of prudence to adjourn from
thence into a place of obscurity, where they might feast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
knuckle-deep in luscious gravy, and enjoy themselves free
from the noisy addresses of the young scholastic rabble;
so that now, whether they have healed the breach, and
are again returned into the Kit-Cat community, from
whence it is believed, upon some disgust, they at first
separated, or whether, like the Calves' Head Club they
remove from place to place, to prevent discovery, I sha'n't
presume to determine; but at the present, like Oates's
army of pilgrims, in the time of the plot, though they
are much talk'd of they are difficult to be found." The
"Secret history" concludes with an address to the Club,
from which these are specimen lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Such strenuous lines, so cheering, soft, and sweet,</p>
<p>That daily flow from your conjunctive wit,</p>
<p>Proclaim the power of Beef, that noble meat.</p>
<p>Your tuneful songs such deep impression make,</p>
<p>And of such awful, beauteous strength partake,</p>
<p>Each stanza seems an ox, each line a steak.</p>
<p>As if the rump in slices, broil'd or stew'd</p>
<p>In its own gravy, till divinely good,</p>
<p>Turned all to powerful wit, as soon as chew'd.</p>
<hr class="l15poem" />
<p>To grind thy gravy out their jaws employ,</p>
<p>O'er heaps of reeking steaks express their joy,</p>
<p>And sing of Beef as Homer did of Troy."</p>
</div>

<p>We shall now more closely examine the origin and
history of the Sublime Society of the Steaks, which has
its pedigree, its ancestry, and its title-deeds. The gridiron
of 1735 is the real gridiron on which its first steak
was broiled. Henry Rich (Lun, the first Harlequin)
was the founder, to whom Garrick thus alludes in a prologue
to the Irish experiment of a speaking pantomime:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When Lun appeared, with matchless art and whim,</p>
<p>He gave the power of speech to every limb.</p>
<p>Though masked and mute conveyed his true intent,</p>
<p>And told in frolic gestures what he meant;</p>
<p>But now the motley coat and sword of wood,</p>
<p>Require a tongue to make them understood."</p>
</div>

<p>There is a letter extant, written by Nixon, the treasurer,
probably to some artist, granting permission by
the Beef-steak Society "to copy the original gridiron, and
I have wrote on the other side of this sheet a note to
Mr. White, at the Bedford, to introduce you to our
room for the purpose making your drawing. The first
spare moment I can take from my business shall be employed
in making a short statement of the rise and
establishment of the Beef-steak Society."</p>

<p>Rich, in 1732, left the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre
for Covent Garden, the success of the <i>Beggars' Opera</i>
having "made Gay rich and Rich gay." He was accustomed
to arrange the comic business and construct
the models of tricks for his pantomimes in his private
room at Covent Garden. Here resorted men of rank
and wit, for Rich's colloquial oddities were much relished.
Thither came Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough,
the friend of Pope, and thus commemorated by Swift:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Mordanto fills the trump of fame;</p>
<p>The Christian world his death proclaim;</p>
<p>And prints are crowded with his name.</p>
<p>In journeys he outrides the post;</p>
<p>Sits up till midnight with his host;</p>
<p>Talks politics, and gives the toast,</p>
<p>A skeleton in outward figure;</p>
<p>His meagre corpse, though full of vigour,</p>
<p>Would halt behind him, were it bigger,</p>
<p>So wonderful his expedition;</p>
<p>When you have not the least suspicion,</p>
<p>He's with you, like an apparition:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>
<p>Shines in all climates like a star;</p>
<p>In senates bold, and fierce in war;</p>
<p>A land-commandant, and a tar."</p>
</div>

<p>He was then advanced in years, and one afternoon
stayed, talking with Rich about his tricks and transformations,
and listening to his agreeable talk, until Rich's dinner-hour,
two o'clock, had arrived. In all these colloquies
with his visitors, whatever their rank, Rich never neglected
his art. Upon one occasion, accident having detained
the Earl's coach later than usual, he found
Rich's chat so agreeable, that he was quite unconscious
it was two o'clock in the afternoon; when he observed
Rich spreading a cloth, then coaxing his fire into a clear
cooking flame, and proceeding, with great gravity, to
cook his own beef-steak on his own gridiron. The steak
sent up a most inviting incense, and my Lord could not
resist Rich's invitation to partake of it. A further
supply was sent for; and a bottle or two of good wine
from a neighbouring tavern prolonged their enjoyment
to a late hour. But so delighted was the old Peer with
the entertainment, that, on going away, he proposed
renewing it at the same place and hour, on the Saturday
following. He was punctual to his engagement, and
brought with him three or four friends, "men of wit
and pleasure about town," as M. Bouges would call
them; and so truly festive was the meeting that it was
proposed a Saturday's club should be held there, whilst
the town remained full. A sumptuary law, even at this
early period of the Society, restricted the bill of fare to
beef-steaks, and the beverage to port-wine and punch.</p>

<p>However, the origin of the Society is related <i>with a
difference</i>. Edwards, in his <i>Anecdotes of Painting</i>, relates
that Lambert, many years principal scene-painter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
at Covent Garden Theatre, received, in his painting-room,
persons of rank and talent; where, as he could
not leave for dinner, he frequently was content with a
steak, which he himself broiled upon the fire in his
room. Sometimes the visitors partook of the hasty
meal, and out of this practice grew the Beef-steak Society,
and the assembling in the painting-room. The
members were afterwards accommodated with a room in
the playhouse; and when the Theatre was rebuilt, the
place of meeting was changed to the Shakespeare Tavern,
where was the portrait of Lambert, painted by
Hudson, Sir Joshua Reynolds's master.</p>

<p>In the <i>Connoisseur</i>, June 6th, 1754, we read of the
Society, "composed of the most ingenious artists in the
Kingdom," meeting "every Saturday in a noble room
at the top of Covent Garden Theatre," and never suffering
"any diet except Beef-steaks to appear. These,
indeed, are most glorious examples: but what, alas! are
the weak endeavours of a few to oppose the daily inroads
of fricassees and soup-maigres?"</p>

<p>However, the apartments in the theatre appropriated
to the Society varied. Thus, we read of a painting-room
even with the stage over the kitchen, which was
under part of the stage nearest Bow-street. At one
period, the Society dined in a small room over the passage
of the theatre. The steaks were dressed in the
same room, and when they found it too hot, a curtain
was drawn between the company and the fire.</p>

<p>We shall now glance at the celebrities who came to
the painting-room in the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre,
and the later locations of the Club, in Covent Garden. To
the former came Hogarth and his father-in-law, Sir James
Thornhill, stimulated by their love of the painter's art,
and the equally potent charm of conviviality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>Churchill was introduced to the Steaks by his friend
Wilkes; but his irregularities were too much for the
Society, which was by no means particular; his desertion
of his wife brought a hornets' swarm about him,
so that he soon resigned, to avoid the disgrace of expulsion.
Churchill attributed this flinging of the first stone
to Lord Sandwich; he never forgave the peccant Peer,
but put him into the pillory of his fierce satire, which
has outlived most of his other writings, and here it is:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"From his youth upwards to the present day,</p>
<p>When vices more than years have made him grey;</p>
<p>When riotous excess with wasteful hand</p>
<p>Shakes life's frail glass, and hastes each ebbing sand;</p>
<p>Unmindful from what stock he drew his birth,</p>
<p>Untainted with one deed of real worth&mdash;</p>
<p>Lothario, holding honour at no price,</p>
<p>Folly to folly, added vice to vice,</p>
<p>Wrought sin with greediness, and courted shame</p>
<p>With greater zeal than good men seek for fame."</p>
</div>

<p>Churchill, in a letter to Wilkes, says, "Your friends
at the Beef-steak inquired after you last Saturday with
the greatest zeal, and it gave me no small pleasure that
I was the person of whom the inquiry was made."
Charles Price was allowed to be one of the most witty
of the Society, and it is related that he and Churchill
kept the table in a roar.</p>

<p>Formerly, the members wore a blue coat, with red
cape and cuffs; buttons with the initials B. S.; and
behind the President's chair was placed the Society's
halbert, which, with the gridiron, was found among the
rubbish after the Covent Garden fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Welsh was frequently chairman at the
Beef-steak dinner. Mrs. Nollekens, his daughter, acknowledges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
that she often dressed a hat for the purpose,
with ribbons similar to those worn by the yeomen of the
guard. The Justice was a loyal man, but discontinued
his membership when Wilkes joined the Society; though
the latter was <i>the</i> man at the Steaks.</p>

<p>To the Steaks Wilkes sent a copy of his infamous
<i>Essay on Women</i>, first printed for private circulation;
for which Lord Sandwich&mdash;Jemmy Twitcher&mdash;himself,
as we have seen, a member of the Society&mdash;moved in
the House of the Lords that Wilkes should be taken
into custody; a piece of treason as the act of one brother
of the Steaks against another, fouler than even the
trick of "dirty Kidgell," the parson, who, as a friend of
the author, got a copy of the Essay from the printer,
and then felt it his duty to denounce the publication;
he had been encouraged to inform against Wilkes's
Essay by the Earl of March, afterwards Duke of Queensberry.
However, Jemmy Twitcher himself was expelled
by the Steaks the same year he assailed Wilkes for the
Essay; the grossness and blasphemy of the poem disgusted
the Society; and Wilkes never dined there after
1763; yet, when he went to France, they hypocritically
made him an honorary member.</p>

<p>Garrick was an honoured member of the Steaks;
though he did not affect Clubs. The Society possess a
hat and sword which David wore, probably on the night
when he stayed so long with the Steaks, and had
to play Ranger, at Drury-lane. The pit grew restless,
the gallery bawled "Manager, manager!" Garrick had
been sent for to Covent Garden, where the Steaks then
dined. Carriages blocked up Russell-street, and he had
to thread his way between them; as he came panting
into the theatre, "I think, David," said Ford, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the anxious patentees, "considering the stake you and
I have in this house, you might pay more attention
to the business."&mdash;"True, my good friend," returned
Garrick, "but I was thinking of my steak in the other
house."</p>

<p>Many a reconciliation of parted friends has taken
place at this Club. Peake, in his <i>Memoirs of the Colman
Family</i>, thus refers to a reconciliation between
Garrick and Colman the elder, through the Sublime
Society:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whether Mr. Clutterbuck or other friends interfered
to reconcile the two dramatists, or whether the
considerations of mutual interest may not in a great
measure have aided in healing the breach between Colman
and Garrick, is not precisely to be determined;
but it would appear, from the subjoined short note from
Garrick, that Colman must have made some overture to
him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'My dear Colman,&mdash;Becket has been with me, and
tells me of your friendly intentions towards me. I
should have been beforehand with you, had I not been
ill with the beefsteaks and arrack punch last Saturday,
and was obliged to leave the play-house.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'He that parts us shall bring a brand from Heav'n,</p>
<p>And fire us hence.'</p>
</div>

<p class="left45">"'Ever yours, old and new friend,</p>

<p class="left65">"'<span class="smcap">D. GARRICK</span>.'"</p>
</div>

<p>The beef-steaks, arrack punch, and Saturday, all
savour very strongly of a visit to the Sublime Society
held at that period in Covent Garden Theatre, where
many a clever fellow has had his diaphragm disordered,
before that time and since. Whoever has had the pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to join their convivial board; to witness the never-failing
good-humour which predominates there; to listen
to the merry songs, and to the sparkling repartee; and
to experience the hearty welcome and marked attention
paid to visitors, could never have cause to lament, as
Garrick has done, a trifling illness the following day.
There must have been originally a wise and simple code
of laws, which could have held together a convivial
meeting for so lengthened a period.</p>

<p>Garrick had no slight tincture of vanity, and was fond
of accusing himself, in the Chesterfield phrase, of the
cardinal virtues. Having remarked at the Steaks that
he had so large a mass of manuscript plays submitted to
him, that they were constantly liable to be mislaid, he
observed that, unpleasant as it was to reject an author's
piece, it was an affront to his feelings if it could not be
instantly found; and that for this reason he made a
point of ticketing and labelling the play that was to be
returned, that it might be forthcoming at a moment.
"A fig for your hypocrisy," exclaimed Murphy across
the table; "you know, Davy, you mislaid my tragedy
two months ago, and I make no doubt you have lost it."&mdash;"Yes,"
replied Garrick; "but you forgot, you ungrateful
dog, that I offered you more than its value, for
you might have had two manuscript farces in its stead."
This is the right paternity of an anecdote often told of
other parties.</p>

<p>Jack Richards, a well-known presbyter of the Society,
unless when the "fell serjeant," the gout, had arrested
him, never absented himself from its board. He was
recorder, and there is nothing in comedy equal to his
passing sentence on those who had offended against the
rules and observances of the Society. Having put on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Garrick's hat, he proceeded to inflict a long, wordy
harangue upon the culprit, who often endeavoured most
unavailingly to stop him. Nor was it possible to see
when he meant to stop. But the imperturbable gravity
with which Jack performed his office, and the fruitless
writhings of the luckless being on whom the shower of
his rhetoric was discharged, constituted the amusement
of the scene. There was no subject upon which Jack's
exuberance of talk failed him; yet, in that stream of
talk there was never mingled one drop of malignity, nor
of unkind censure upon the erring or unhappy. He
would as soon adulterate his glass of port-wine with
water, as dash that honest though incessant prattle with
one malevolent or ungenerous remark.</p>

<p>William Linley, the brother of Mrs. Sheridan,
charmed the Society with his pure, simple English
song: in a melody of Arne's, or of Jackson's of Exeter,
or a simple air of his father's, he excelled to admiration,&mdash;faithful
to the characteristic chastity of the style of
singing peculiar to the Linley family. Linley had not
what is called a fine voice, and port-wine and late nights
did not improve his organ; but you forgot the deficiencies
of his power, in the spirit and taste of his
manner. He wrote a novel in three volumes, which was
so schooled by the Steaks that he wrote no more: when
the agony of wounded authorship was over, he used to
exclaim to his tormentors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"This is no flattery; these are the counsellors</p>
<p>That feelingly persuade me what I am."</p>
</div>

<p>His merciless Zoilus brought a volume of the work in
his pocket, and read a passage of it aloud. Yet, Linley
never betrayed the irritable sulkiness of a roasted author,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
but took the pleasantries that played around him with
imperturbable good-humour: he laughed heartily at his
own platitudes, and thus the very martyr of the joke
became its auxiliary. Linley is said to have furnished
Moore, for his <i>Life of Sheridan</i>, with the common-place
books in which his brother-in-law was wont to deposit
his dramatic sketches, and to bottle up the jokes he had
collected for future use; but many pleasantries of Sheridan
were deeply engraved on his recollection because
they had been practised upon himself, or upon his
brother Hozy (as Sheridan called him), who was an unfailing
butt, when he was disposed to amuse himself
with a practical jest.</p>

<p>Another excellent brother was Dick Wilson, whose
volcanic complexion had for many years been assuming
deeper and deeper tints of carnation over the port-wine
of the Society. Dick was a wealthy solicitor, and many
years Lord Eldon's "port-wine-loving secretary." His
fortunes were very singular. He was first steward and
solicitor, and afterwards residuary legatee, of Lord Chedworth.
He is said to have owed the favour of this
eccentric nobleman to the legal acumen he displayed at
a Richmond water-party. A pleasant lawn, under a
spreading beech-tree in one of Mr. Cambridge's meadows,
was selected for the dinner; but on pulling to the
shore, behold a board in the tree proclaiming, "All persons
landing and dining here will be prosecuted according
to law." Dick Wilson contended that the prohibition
clearly applied only to the joint act of "landing
and dining" at the particular spot. If the party landed
a few yards lower down, and then dined under the tree,
only one member of the condition would be broken;
which would be no legal infringement, as the prohibition&mdash;being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of two acts, linked by a copulative&mdash;was not
severable. This astute argument carried the day. The
party dined under Mr. Cambridge's beech-tree, and, it
is presumed, were not "prosecuted according to law." At
all events, Lord Chedworth, who was one of the diners,
was so charmed with Dick's ready application of his law
to practice, that he committed to him the management
of his large and accumulating property.</p>

<p>Dick stood the fire of the Steaks with good humour;
but he was sometimes unmercifully roasted. He had
just returned from Paris, when Arnold, with great dexterity,
drew him into some Parisian details, with great
glee; for Dick was entirely innocent of the French language.
Thus, in enumerating the dishes at a French
table, he thought the <i>boulevards</i> delicious; when Cobbe
called out, "Dick, it was well they did not serve you at
the Palais Royal for sauce to your <i>boulevards</i>." The
<i>riz de veau</i> he called a <i>rendezvous</i>; and he could not
bear partridges served up <i>in shoes</i>; and once, intending
to ask for a pheasant, he desired the waiter to bring him
a <i>paysanne</i>! Yet, Dick was shrewd: calling one day
upon Cobbe at the India House, Dick was left to himself
for a few minutes, when he was found by Cobbe, on
his return, exploring a map of Asia suspended on the
wall: he was measuring the scale of it with compasses,
and then applying them to a large tiger, which the artist
had introduced as one of the animals of the country.
"By heavens, Cobbe," exclaimed Dick, "I should never
have believed it! Surely, it must be a mistake. Observe
now&mdash;here," pointing to the tiger, "here is a tiger
that measures two-and-twenty leagues. By heavens, it
is scarcely credible."</p>

<p>Another of the noteworthy Steaks was "Old Walsh,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
commonly called "the Gentle Shepherd:" he began life
as a servant of the celebrated Lord Chesterfield, and
accompanied his natural son, Philip Stanhope, on the
grand tour, as valet: after this he was made a Queen's
messenger, and subsequently a Commissioner of Customs;
he was a good-natured butt for the Society's
jokes. Rowland Stephenson, the banker, was another
Beef-Steaker, then respected for his clear head and
warm heart, years before he became branded as a forger.
At the same table was a capitalist of very high character&mdash;William
Joseph Denison, who sat many years in
Parliament for Surrey, and died a <i>millionnaire</i>: he was a
man of cultivated tastes, and long enjoyed the circle of
the Steaks.</p>

<p>We have seen how the corner-stone of the sublime Society
was laid. The gridiron upon which Rich had broiled
his solitary steak, being insufficient in a short time for
the supernumerary guests, the gridiron was enshrined as
one of the tutelary and household emblems of the Club.
Fortunately, it escaped the fire which consumed Covent
Garden Theatre in 1808, when the valuable stock of
wine of the Club shared the fate of the building; but
<i>the gridiron was saved</i>. "In that fire, alas!" says the
author of <i>The Clubs of London</i>, "perished the original
archives of the Society. The lovers of wit and pleasantry
have much to deplore in that loss, inasmuch as not only
the names of many of the early members are irretrievably
gone, but what is more to be regretted, some of their
happiest effusions; for it was then customary to register
in the weekly records anything of striking excellence
that had been hit off in the course of the evening. This,
however, is certain, that the Beaf-steaks, from its foundation
to the present hour, has been&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i6">"'native to famous wits</p>
<p>Or hospitable.'</p>
</div>

<p>That, as guests or members, persons distinguished for
rank, and social and convivial powers, have, through
successive generations, been seated at its festive board&mdash;
Bubb Dodington, Aaron Hill; Hoadley, author of <i>The
Suspicious Husband</i>, and Leonidas Glover, are only a few
names snatched from its early list. Sir Peere Williams,
a gentleman of high birth and fashion, who had already
shone in Parliament, was of the Club. Then came the
days of Lord Sandwich, Wilkes, Bonnell Thornton,
Arthur Murphy, Churchill, and Tickell. This is generally
quoted as the golden period of the Society." Then there
were the Colmans and Garrick; and John Beard, the
singer, was president of the Club in 1784.</p>

<p>The number of the Steaks was increased from twenty-four
to twenty-five, in 1785, to admit the Prince of
Wales, an event of sufficient moment to find record in
the <i>Annual Register</i> of the year: "On Saturday, the
14th of May, the Prince of Wales was admitted a member
of the Beaf-steak Club. His Royal Highness having
signified his wish of belonging to that Society, and there
not being a vacancy, it was proposed to make him an
honorary member; but that being declined by His
Royal Highness, it was agreed to increase the number
from twenty-four to twenty-five, in consequence of which
His Royal Highness was unanimously elected. The
Beaf-steak Club has been instituted just fifty years, and
consists of some of the most classical and sprightly wits
in the Kingdom." It is curious to find the Society
here termed a Club, contrary to its desire, for it stickled
much for the distinction.</p>

<p>Arthur Murphy, the dramatist, John Kemble, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Dukes of Clarence and of Sussex, were also of the Steaks:
these princes were both attached to the theatre; the
latter to one of its brightest ornaments, Dorothy Jordan.</p>

<p>Charles, Duke of Norfolk, was another celebrity of
the Steaks, and frequently met here the Prince of Wales.
The Duke was a great gourmand, and, it is said, used to
eat his dish of fish at a neighbouring tavern&mdash;the Piazza,
or the Grand&mdash;and then join the Steaks. His <i>fidus
Achates</i> was Charles Morris, the laureate-lyrist of the
Steaks. Their attachment was unswerving, notwithstanding
it has been impeached. The poet kept better
hours than his ducal friend: one evening, Morris having
left the dinner-table early, a friend gave some significant
hints as to the improvement of Morris's fortunes: the
Duke grew generous over his wine, and promised; the
performance came, and Morris lived to the age of ninety-three,
to enjoy the realization.</p>

<p>The Duke took the chair when the cloth was removed.
It was a place of dignity, elevated some steps above the
table, and decorated with the insignia of the Society,
amongst which was suspended Garrick's <i>Ranger</i> hat.
As the clock struck five, a curtain drew up, discovering
the kitchen, in which the cooks were seen at work,
through a sort of grating, with this inscription from
Macbeth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well</p>
<p>It were done quickly."</p>
</div>

<p>The steaks themselves were in the finest order, and
in devouring them no one surpassed His Grace of Norfolk:
two or three steaks, fragrant from the gridiron,
vanished, and when his labours were thought to be over,
he might be seen rubbing a clean plate with a shalot
for the reception of another. A pause of ten minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
ensued, and His Grace rested upon his knife and fork:
he was tarrying for a steak from the middle of the rump
of beef, where lurks a fifth essence, the perfect ideal of
tenderness and flavour. The Duke was an enormous
eater. He would often eat between three and four
pounds of beaf-steak; and after that take a Spanish
onion and beet-root, chop them together with oil and
vinegar, and eat them. After dinner, the Duke was
ceremoniously ushered to the chair, and invested with
an orange-coloured ribbon, to which a small silver gridiron<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
was appended. In the chair he comported himself
with urbanity and good humour. Usually, the President
was the target, at which all the jests and witticisms
were fired, but moderately; for though a characteristic
equality reigned at the Steaks, the influences of rank
and station were felt there, and courtesy stole insensibly
upon those who at other times were merciless assailants
on the chair. The Duke's conversation abounded with
anecdote, terseness of phrase, and evidence of extensive
reading, which were rarely impaired by the sturdy port-wine
of the Society. Charles Morris, the Bard of the Club, sang
one or two of his own songs, the quintessence of convivial
mirth and fancy; at nine o'clock the Duke quitted the
chair, and was succeeded by Sir John Hippisley, who had
a terrible time of it: a storm of "arrowy sleet and iron
shower" whistled from all points in his ears: all rules
of civilized warfare seemed suspended, and even the new
members tried their first timid essays upon the Baronet,
than whom no man was more prompt to attack others.
He quitted the Society in consequence of an odd adventure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
which really happened to him, and which, being related
with malicious fidelity by one of the Steaks, raised
such a shout of laughter at the Baronet's expense that
he could no longer bear it. Here is the story.</p>

<p>Sir John was an intelligent man; Windham used to
say of him that he was very near being a clever man.
He was a sort of busy idler; and his ruling passion was
that of visiting remarkable criminals in prison, and obtaining
their histories from their own lips. A murder
had been committed, by one Patch, upon a Mr. Bligh,
at Deptford; the evidence was circumstantial, but the
inference of his guilt was almost irresistible; still many
well-disposed persons doubted the man's guilt, and
amongst them was Sir John, who thought the anxiety
could only be relieved by Patch's confession. For this
end, Sir John importuned the poor wretch incessantly,
but in vain. Patch persisted in asserting his innocence,
till, wearied with Hippisley's applications, he assured the
Baronet that he would reveal to him, on the scaffold, all
that he knew of Mr. Bligh's death. Flattered with being
made the depository of this mysterious communication,
Sir John mounted the scaffold with Patch, and was
seen for some minutes in close conference with him. It
happened that a simple old woman from the country was
in the crowd at the execution. Her eyes, intent upon
the awful scene, were fixed, by an accidental misdirection,
upon Sir John, whom she mistook for the person who
was about to be executed; and not waiting till the criminal
was actually turned off, she went away with the wrong
impression; the peculiar face, and above all, the peculiar
nose (a most miraculous organ), of Hippisley, being
indelibly impressed upon her memory. Not many days
after, the old lady met Sir John in Cheapside; the certainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
that he was Patch, seized her so forcibly that she
screamed out to the passing crowd, "It's Patch, it's
Patch; I saw him hanged; Heaven deliver me!"&mdash;and
then fainted. When this incident was first related at
the Steaks, a mock inquest was set on foot, to decide
whether Sir John was Patch or not, and unanimously decided
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Cobb, Secretary of the East India Company, was another
choice spirit at the Steaks: once, when he filled
the vice-chair, he so worried the poor president, an Alderman,
that he exclaimed, "Would to Heaven, I had another
vice-president, so that I had a <i>gentleman</i> opposite
to me!"&mdash;"Why should you wish any such thing?"
rejoined Cobb; "you cannot be more opposite to a gentleman
than you are at present."</p>

<p>After the fire at Covent Garden, the Sublime Society
were re-established at the Bedford, where they met until
Mr. Arnold had fitted up apartments for their reception
in the English Opera House. The Steaks continued to
meet here until the destruction of the Theatre by fire, in
1830; after which they returned to the Bedford; and,
upon the re-building of the Lyceum Theatre, a dining-room
was again provided for them. "The room they
dine in," says Mr. Cunningham, "a little Escurial in
itself, is most appropriately fitted up&mdash;the doors, wainscoting,
and roof, of good old English oak, ornamented
with gridirons as thick as Henry the Seventh's Chapel
with the portcullis of the founder. Everything assumes
the shape, or is distinguished by the representation, of
their emblematic implement, the gridiron. The cook is
seen at his office through the bars of a spacious gridiron,
and the original gridiron of the Society, (the survivor of
two terrific fires) holds a conspicuous position in the centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of the ceiling. Every member has the power of inviting
a friend." The portraits of several worthies of
the Sublime Society were painted: one brother "hangs
in chain," as Arnold remarked in alluding to the civic
chain in which he is represented; it was in allusion to
the toga in which he is painted, that Brougham, being
asked whether he thought it a likeness, remarked that
it could not fail of being like him, "there was so much
of the <i>fur</i> (thief) about it."</p>

<p>The author of the <i>Clubs of London</i>, who was a member
of the Sublime Society, describes a right in favouring
them, "a brotherhood, a sentiment of equality. How
you would laugh to see the junior member emerging from
the cellar, with half-a-dozen bottles in a basket! I have
seen Brougham employed in this honourable diplomacy,
and executing it with the correctness of a butler. The
Duke of Leinster, in his turn, took the same duty.</p>

<p>"With regard to Brougham, at first sight you would
not set him down as having a natural and prompt alacrity
for the style of humour that prevails amongst us. But
Brougham is an excellent member, and is a remarkable
instance of the peculiar influences of this peculiar Society
on the human character. We took him just as the
schools of philosophy, the bar, the senate, had made him.
Literary, forensic, and parliamentary habits are most intractable
materials, you will say, to make a member of
the Steaks, yet no man has imbibed more of its spirit,
and he enters its occasional gladiatorship with the greatest
glee."</p>

<p>Admirable were the offhand puns and passes, which,
though of a legal character, were played off by Bolland,
another member of the Society. Brougham was putting
hypothetically the case of a man convicted of felony, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
duly hanged according to law; but restored to life by
medical appliances; and asked what would be the man's
defence if again brought to trial. "Why," returned
Bolland, "it would be for him to plead <i>a cord</i> and satisfaction."
["Accord and satisfaction" is a common
plea in legal practice.] The same evening were talked
over Dean Swift's ingenious but grotesque puns upon
the names of antiquity, such as Ajax, Archimedes, and
others equally well known. Bolland remarked that
when Swift was looking out for those humorous quibbles,
it was singular that it should never have occurred
to him that among the shades that accost Æneas in the
sixth book of the Æneid, there was a Scotchman of the
name of Hugh Forbes. Those who had read Virgil began
to stare. "It is quite plain," said Bolland: "the
ghost exclaims, 'Olim Euphorbus eram.'"</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN MORRIS,<br />
THE BARD OF THE BEEF-STEAK SOCIETY.</h2>

<p>Hitherto we have mentioned but incidentally Charles
Morris, the Nestor and the laureate of the Steaks; but
he merits fuller record. "Alas! poor Yorick! we knew
him well;" we remember his "political vest," to which
he addressed a sweet lyric&mdash;"The Old Whig Poet to his
Old Buff Waistcoat."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Nor can we forget his courteous
manner and his gentlemanly pleasantry, and
his unflagging cheerfulness, long after he had retired to
enjoy the delights of rural life, despite the early prayer
of his racy verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"In town let me live then, in town let me die;</p>
<p>For in truth I can't relish the country, not I.</p>
<p>If one must have a villa in summer to dwell,</p>
<p>Oh! give me the sweet shady side of Pall Mall."</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>This "sweet shady side" has almost disappeared; and
of the palace whereat he was wont to shine, not a trace
remains, save the name. Charles Morris was born of good
family, in 1745, and appears to have inherited a taste for
lyric composition; for his father composed the popular
song of <i>Kitty Crowder</i>. For half a century, Morris moved
in the first circles of rank and gaiety: he was the "Sun
of the table," at Carlton House, as well as at Norfolk
House; and attaching himself politically as well as convivially
to his table companions, he composed the celebrated
ballads of "Billy's too young to drive us," and
"Billy Pitt and the Farmer," which were clever satires
upon the ascendant politics of their day. His humorous
ridicule of the Tories was, however, but ill repaid by
the Whigs; at least, if we may trust the Ode to the
Buff Waistcoat, written in 1815. His 'Songs Political
and Convivial,' many of which were sung at the
Steaks' board, became very popular. In 1830, we possessed
a copy of the 24th edition, with a portrait of the
author, half-masked; one of the ditties was described
to have been "sung by the Prince of Wales to a certain
lady," to the air of "There's a difference between a
Beggar and a Queen;" some of the early songs were
condemned for their pruriency, and were omitted in subsequent
editions. His best Anacreontic is the song <i>Ad
Poculum</i>, for which Morris received the Gold Cup from
the Harmonic Society:</p>

<p>The friendship of the Duke of Norfolk and Charles
Morris extended far beyond the Steaks meetings; and
the author of the <i>Clubs of London</i> tells us by what means
the Duke's regard took a more permanent form. It
appears that John Kemble had sat very late at one of
the night potations at Norfolk House. Charles Morris
had just retired, and a very small party remained in the
dining-room, when His Grace of Norfolk began to deplore,
somewhat pathetically, the smallness of the stipend
upon which poor Charles was obliged to support his
family; observing, that it was a discredit to the age, that
a man, who had so long gladdened the lives of so many
titled and opulent associates, should be left to struggle
with the difficulties of an inadequate income at a time
of life when he had no reasonable hope of augmenting
it. Kemble listened with great attention to the Duke's
<i>jeremiade</i>; but after a slight pause, his feelings getting
the better of his deference, he broke out thus, in a tone
of peculiar emphasis:&mdash;"And does your Grace sincerely
lament the destitute condition of your friend, with whom
you have passed so many agreeable hours? Your Grace
has described that condition most feelingly. But is it
possible, that the greatest Peer of the realm, luxuriating
amidst the prodigalities of fortune, should lament the
distress which he does not relieve? the empty phrase
of benevolence&mdash;the mere breath and vapour of generous
sentiment, become no man; they certainly are unworthy
of your Grace. Providence, my Lord Duke, has placed
you in a station where the wish to do good and the
doing it are the same thing. An annuity from your
overflowing coffers, or a small nook of land, clipped from
your unbounded domains, would scarcely be felt by your
Grace; but you would be repaid, my Lord, with usury;&mdash;with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
tears of grateful joy; with prayers warm from
a bosom which your bounty will have rendered happy."</p>

<p>Such was the substance of Kemble's harangue. Jack
Bannister used to relate the incident, by ingeniously
putting the speech into blank verse, or rather the species
of prose into which Kemble's phraseology naturally
fell when he was highly animated. But, however expressed,
it produced its effect. For though the Duke
(the night was pretty far gone, and several bottles had
been emptied) said nothing at the time, but stared with
some astonishment at so unexpected a lecture; not
a month elapsed before Charles Morris was invested
with a beautiful retreat at Brockham, in Surrey, upon
the bank of the river Mole, and at the foot of the noble
range of which Box Hill forms the most picturesque
point.</p>

<p>The Duke went to his rest in 1815. Morris continued
to be the laureate of the Steaks until the year
1831, when he thus bade adieu to the Society in his
eighty-sixth year:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Adieu to the world! where I gratefully own,</p>
<p>Few men more delight or more comfort have known:</p>
<p>To an age far beyond mortal lot have I trod</p>
<p>The path of pure health, that best blessing of God;</p>
<p>And so mildly devout Nature temper'd my frame,</p>
<p>Holy patience still sooth'd when Adversity came;</p>
<p>Thus with mind ever cheerful, and tongue never tired,</p>
<p>I sung the gay strains these sweet blessings inspired;</p>
<p>And by blending light mirth with a moral-mix'd stave,</p>
<p>Won the smile of the gay and the nod of the grave.</p>
<p>But at length the dull languor of mortal decay</p>
<p>Throws a weight on its spirit too light for its clay;</p>
<p>And the fancy, subdued, as the body's opprest,</p>
<p>Resigns the faint flights that scarce wake in the breast.</p>
<p>A painful memento that man's not to play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>
<p>A game of light folly through Life's sober day;</p>
<p>A just admonition, though view'd with regret,</p>
<p>Still blessedly offer'd, though thanklessly met.</p>
<p>Too long, I perhaps, like the many who stray,</p>
<p>Have upheld the gay themes of the Bacchanal's day;</p>
<p>But at length Time has brought, what it ever will bring,</p>
<p>A shade that excites more to sigh than to sing.</p>
<p>In this close of Life's chapter, ye high-favour'd few,</p>
<p>Take my Muse's last tribute&mdash;this painful adieu!</p>
<p>Take my wish, that your bright social circle on earth</p>
<p>For ever may flourish in concord and mirth;</p>
<p>For the long years of joy I have shared at your board,</p>
<p>Take the thanks of my heart&mdash;where they long have been stored;</p>
<p>And remember, when Time tolls my last passing knell,</p>
<p>The 'old bard' dropp'd a tear, and then bade ye&mdash;Farewell!"</p>
</div>

<p>In 1835, however, Morris revisited the Society, who
then presented him with a large silver bowl, appropriately
inscribed, as a testimonial of their affectionate
esteem; and the venerable bard thus addressed the brotherhood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Well, I'm come, my dear friends, your kind wish to obey,</p>
<p>And drive, by light mirth, all Life's shadows away;</p>
<p>And turn the heart's sighs to the throbbings of joy,</p>
<p>And a grave aged man to a merry old boy.</p>
<p>'Tis a bold transformation, a daring design,</p>
<p>And not past the power of Friendship and Wine;</p>
<p>And I trust that e'en yet this warm mixture will raise</p>
<p>A brisk spark of light o'er the shade of my days."</p>
</div>

<p>Shortly after this effusion, he thus alluded to the
treasured gift of the Society:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When my spirits are low, for relief and delight,</p>
<p>I still place your splendid Memorial in sight;</p>
<p>And call to my Muse, when care strives to pursue,</p>
<p>'Bring the Steaks to my Memory and the Bowl to my view.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>
<p>When brought, at its sight all the <i>blue devils</i> fly,</p>
<p>And a world of gay visions rise bright to my eye;</p>
<p>Cold Fear shuns the cup where warm Memory flows;</p>
<p>And Grief, shamed by Joy, hides his budget of Woes.</p>
<p>'Tis a pure holy fount, where for ever I find</p>
<p>A sure double charm for the Body and Mind;</p>
<p>For I feel while I'm cheer'd by the drop that I lift,</p>
<p>I'm Blest by the Motive that hallows the Gift."</p>
</div>

<p>How nicely tempered is this chorus to our Bard's
"Life's a Fable:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Then roll along, my lyric song;</p>
<p class="i1">It seasons well the table,</p>
<p>And tells a truth to Age and Youth,</p>
<p class="i1">That Life's a fleeting fable.</p>
<hr class="l15poem" />
<p>Thus Mirth and Woe the brighter show</p>
<p class="i1">From rosy wine's reflection;</p>
<p>From first to last, this truth hath past&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">'Twas made for Care's correction.</p>
<p>Now what those think who water drink,</p>
<p class="i1">Of these old rules of Horace,</p>
<p>I sha'n't now show; but this I know,</p>
<p class="i1">His rules do well for <i>Morris</i>.</p>
<p>Old Horace, when he dipp'd his pen,</p>
<p class="i1">'Twas wine he had resort to;</p>
<p>He chose for use Falernian juice,</p>
<p class="i1">As I choose old Oporto;</p>
<p>At every bout an ode came out,</p>
<p class="i1">Yet Bacchus kept him twinkling;</p>
<p>As well aware more fire was there,</p>
<p class="i1">Which wanted but the sprinkling."</p>
</div>
<hr class="l15" />

<p>At Brockham, Morris "drank the pure pleasures of
the rural life" long after many a gay light of his own
time had flickered out, and become almost forgotten. At
length, his course ebbed away, July 11, 1838, in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
ninety-third year; his illness, which was only of four days,
was internal inflammation. The attainment of so great
an age, and the recollection of Morris's associations,
show him to have presented a rare combination of
mirth and prudence. He retained his <i>gaîté de c&oelig;ur</i> to
the last; so that with equal truth he remonstrated:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When Life charms my heart, must I kindly be told,</p>
<p>I'm too gay and too happy for one that's so old?"</p>
</div>

<p>The venerable Bard's remains rest near the east end
of his parish church of Betchworth, in the burial-ground:
the grave is simply marked by a head and
foot-stone, with an inscription of three or four lines:
he who had sung the praises of so many choice spirits,
has not here a stanza to his own memory: such is, to
some extent, the natural <i>sequitur</i> with men who outlive
their companions. Morris was staid and grave in his
general deportment. Moore, in his <i>Diary</i>, has this odd
note: "Linley describes Colman at the Beefsteak Club
quite drunk, making extraordinary noise while Captain
Morris was singing, which disconcerted the latter (who,
strange to say, is a very grave, steady person) considerably."
Yet, Morris could unbend, with great simplicity
and feeling. We have often met him, in his patriarchal
"blue and buff" (blue coat and buff waistcoat), in his
walks about the lovely country in which he resided.
Coming, one day, into the bookseller's shop, at Dorking,
there chanced to be deposited a pianoforte; when
the old Bard having looked around him, to see there
were no strangers present, sat down to the instrument,
and played and sang with much spirit the air of "The
girl I left behind me:" yet he was then past his eightieth
year.</p>

<p>Morris's ancient and rightful office at the Steaks was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
to <i>make the punch</i>, and it was amusing to see him at his
laboratory at the sideboard, stocked with the various products
that enter into the composition of that nectareous
mixture: then smacking an elementary glass or two, and
giving a significant nod, the fiat of its excellence; and
what could exceed the ecstasy with which he filled the
glasses that thronged around the bowl; joying over
its mantling beauties, and distributing the fascinating
draught</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"That flames and dances in its crystal bound"?</p>
</div>

<p>"Well has our laureate earned his wreath," (says the
author of <i>The Clubs of London</i>, who was often a participator
in these delights). "At that table his best songs
have been sung; for that table his best songs were written.
His allegiance has been undivided. Neither hail,
nor shower, nor snowstorm have kept him away: no engagement,
no invitation seduced him from it. I have seen
him there, 'outwatching the bear,' in his seventy-eighth
year; for as yet nature had given no signal of decay in
frame or faculty; but you saw him in a green and vigorous
old age, tripping mirthfully along the downhill
of existence, without languor, or gout, or any of the privileges
exacted by time for the mournful privilege of
living. His face is still resplendent with cheerfulness.
'Die when you will, Charles,' said Curran to him, 'you
will die in your youth.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>BEEF-STEAK CLUBS.</h2>

<p>There are other Beef-steak Clubs to be chronicled.
Pyne, in his <i>Wine and Walnuts</i>, says: "At the same
time the social Club flourished in England, and about
the year 1749, a Beef-steak Club was established at the
Theatre Royal, Dublin, of which the celebrated Mrs.
Margaret Woffington was president. It was begun by
Mr. Sheridan, but on a very different plan to that in
London, no theatrical performer, save one <i>female</i>, being
admitted; and though called a Club, the manager alone
bore all the expenses. The plan was, by making a list of
about fifty or sixty persons, chiefly noblemen and members
of Parliament, who were invited. Usually about
half that number attended, and dined in the manager's
apartment in the theatre. There was no female admitted
but this <i>Peg Woffington</i>, so denominated by all
her contemporaries, who was seated in a great chair at
the head of the table, and elected president for the
season.</p>

<p>"'It will readily be believed,' says Mr. Victor, in his
<i>History of the Theatres</i>, who was joint proprietor of the
house, 'that a club where there were good accommodations,
such a <i>lovely president</i>, full of wit and spirit,
and <i>nothing to pay</i>, must soon grow remarkably fashionable.'
It did so; but we find it subsequently caused
the theatre to be pulled to pieces about the manager's
head.</p>

<p>"Mr. Victor says of Mrs. Margaret, 'she possessed
captivating charms as a jovial, witty bottle companion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
but few remaining as a mere female,' We have Dr.
Johnson's testimony, however, who had often gossiped
with Mrs. Margaret in the green-room at old Drury,
more in the lady's favour.</p>

<p>"This author (Victor) says, speaking of the Beef-steak
Club, 'It was a club of ancient institution in every
theatre; when the principal performers dined one day in
the week together (generally Saturday), and authors and
other geniuses were admitted members.'"</p>

<p>The Club in Ivy-lane, of which Dr. Johnson was a
member, was originally a Beef-steak Club.</p>

<p>There was also a political Club, called "the Rump
Steak, or Liberty Club," in existence in 1733-4. The
members were in eager opposition to Sir Robert Walpole.</p>

<p>At the Bell Tavern, Church-row, Houndsditch, was
held the Beef-steak Club, instituted by Mr. Beard, Mr.
Dunstall, Mr. Woodward, Stoppalear, Bencroft, Gifford,
etc.&mdash;<i>See Memoirs of Charles Lee Lewis</i>, vol. ii. p. 196.</p>

<h2>CLUB AT TOM'S COFFEE-HOUSE.</h2>

<p>Covent-Garden has lost many of its houses "studded
with anecdote and history;" and the mutations among
what Mr. Thackeray affectionately called its "rich cluster
of brown taverns" are sundry and manifest. Its
coffee-houses proper have almost disappeared, even in
name. Yet, in the last century, in one short street of
Covent-Garden&mdash;Russell-street&mdash;flourished three of the
most celebrated coffee-houses in the metropolis: Will's,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Button's, and Tom's. The reader need not be reminded
of Will's, with Dryden, the <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>, and its
wits' room on the first floor; or Button's, with its lion's
head letter-box, and the young poets in the back room.
Tom's, No. 17, on the north side of Russell-street, and
of somewhat later date, was taken down in 1865. The
premises remained with little alteration, long after they
ceased to be a coffee-house. It was named after its original
proprietor, Thomas West, who, Nov. 26, 1722,
threw himself, in a delirium, from the second-floor window
into the street, and died immediately (<i>Historical
Register</i> for 1722). The upper portion of the premises
was the coffee-house, under which lived T. Lewis, the
bookseller, the original publisher, in 1711, of Pope's
<i>Essay on Criticism</i>. The usual frequenters upstairs may
be judged of by the following passage in the <i>Journey
through England</i>, first edit., 1714:&mdash;"After the play,
the best company generally go to Tom's and Will's
coffee-houses, near adjoining, where there is playing at
piquet and the best conversation till midnight. Here
you will see blue and green ribbons, with stars, sitting
familiarly and talking with the same freedom as if they
had left their quality and degrees of distance at home;
and a stranger tastes with pleasure the universal liberty
of speech of the English nation. And in all the coffee-houses
you have not only the foreign prints, but several
English ones, with the foreign occurrences, besides papers
of morality and party disputes." Such were the Augustan
delights of a memorable coffee-house of the reign of
Queen Anne. Of this period is a recollection of Mr.
Grignon, sen., having seen the "balcony of Tom's
crowded with noblemen in their stars and garters, drinking
their tea and coffee exposed to the people." We find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
an entry in Walpole's <i>Letters</i>, 1745:&mdash;"A gentleman,
I don't know who, the other night at Tom's coffee-house,
said, on Lord Baltimore refusing to come into the Admiralty
because Lord Vere Beauclerk had the precedence,
'it put him in mind of Pinkethman's petition in the
<i>Spectator</i>, where he complains that formerly he used to act
second chair in "Diocletian," but now he was reduced
to dance fifth flower-pot.'"</p>

<p>In 1764 there appears to have been formed here, by a
guinea subscription, a Club of nearly 700 members&mdash;the
nobility, foreign ministers, gentry, and men of genius of
the age; the large front room on the first floor being the
card-room. The Club flourished, so that in 1768, "having
considerably enlarged itself of late," Thomas Haines,
the then proprietor, took in the front room of the next
house westward as a coffee-room. The front room of
No. 17 was then appropriated exclusively as a card-room
for the subscription club, each member paying one guinea
annually; the adjoining apartment being used as a conversation-room.
The subscription-books are before us,
and here we find in the long list the names of Sir Thomas
Robinson, Bart., who was designated "Long Sir
Thomas Robinson," to distinguish him from his namesake,
Sir Thomas Robinson, created Lord Grantham in
1761. "Long Tom," as the former was familiarly called,
was a Commissioner of Excise and Governor of Barbadoes.
He was a sad bore, especially to the Duke of
Newcastle, the minister, who resided in Lincoln's Inn
Fields. However, he gave rise to some smart things.
Lord Chesterfield being asked by the latter Baronet to
write some verses upon him, immediately produced this
epigram:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Unlike my subject now shall be my song,</p>
<p>It shall be witty, and it shan't be long."</p>
</div>

<p>Long Sir Thomas distinguished himself in this odd
manner. When our Sovereign had not dropped the folly
of calling himself "King of France," and it was customary
at the Coronation of an English Sovereign to
have fictitious Dukes of Aquitaine and Normandy to represent
the vassalage of France, Sir Thomas was selected
to fill the second mock dignity at the coronation of
George III., to which Churchill alludes in his <i>Ghost</i>;
but he assigns a wrong dukedom to Sir Thomas:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Could Satire not (though doubtful since</p>
<p>Whether he plumber is or prince)</p>
<p>Tell of a simple Knight's advance,</p>
<p>To be a doughty peer of France?</p>
<p>Tell how he did a dukedom gain,</p>
<p>And Robinson was Aquitain."</p>
</div>

<p>Of the two Sir Thomas Robinsons, one was tall and
thin, the other short and fat: "I can't imagine," said Lady
Townshend, "why the one should be preferred to the
other; I see but little difference between them: the one
is as broad as the other is long."</p>

<p>Next on the books is Samuel Foote, who, after the
decline of Tom's, was mostly to be seen at the Bedford.
Then comes Arthur Murphy, lately called to the Bar;
David Garrick, who then lived in Southampton-street,
(though he was not a clubbable man); John Beard, the
fine tenor singer; John Webb; Sir Richard Glynne;
Robert Gosling, the banker; Colonel Eyre, of Marylebone;
Earl Percy; Sir John Fielding, the justice; Paul
Methuen, of Corsham; Richard Clive; the great Lord
Clive; the eccentric Duke of Montagu; Sir Fletcher
Norton, the ill-mannered; Lord Edward Bentinck; Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Samuel Johnson; the celebrated Marquis of Granby;
Sir F. B. Delaval, the friend of Foote; William Tooke,
the solicitor; the Hon. Charles Howard, sen.; the Duke
of Northumberland; Sir Francis Gosling; the Earl of
Anglesey; Sir George Brydges Rodney (afterwards Lord
Rodney); Peter Burrell; Walpole Eyre; Lewis Mendez;
Dr. Swinney; Stephen Lushington; John Gunning;
Henry Brougham, father of Lord Brougham; Dr. Macnamara;
Sir John Trevelyan; Captain Donellan; Sir W.
Wolseley; Walter Chetwynd; Viscount Gage, etc.;&mdash;Thomas
Payne, Esq., of Leicester House; Dr. Schomberg,
of Pall-Mall; George Colman, the dramatist, then
living in Great Queen Street; Dr. Dodd, in Southampton-row;
James Payne, the architect, Salisbury-street,
which he rebuilt; William Bowyer, the printer, Bloomsbury-square;
Count Bruhl, the Polish Minister; Dr.
Goldsmith, Temple (1773), etc. Many a noted name in
the list of 700 is very suggestive of the gay society of the
period. Among the Club musters, Samuel Foote, Sir Thomas
Robinson, and Dr. Dodd are very frequent: indeed,
Sir Thomas seems to have been something like a proposer-general.</p>

<p>Tom's appears to have been a general coffee-house;
for in the parish books of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, is
the entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Haines, the landlord, was succeeded by his son.
Thomas, whose daughter is living, at the age of eighty-four,
and possesses a portrait, by Dance, of the elder
Haines, who, from his polite address, was called among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the Club "Lord Chesterfield." The above lady has also
a portrait, in oil, of the younger Haines, by Grignon.</p>

<p>The coffee-house business closed in 1814, about which
time the premises were first occupied by Mr. William Till,
the numismatist. The card-room remained in its original
condition; "And, here," wrote Mr. Till, many
years since, "the tables on which I exhibit my coins are
those which were used by the exalted characters whose
names are extracted from books of the Club, still in possession
of the proprietress of the house." On the death
of Mr. Till, Mr. Webster succeeded to the tenancy and
collection of coins and medals, which he removed to
No. 6, Henrietta-street, shortly before the old premises
in Russell-street were taken down. He possesses, by
marriage with the grand-daughter of the second Mr.
Haines, the old Club books, as well as the curious memorial,
the snuffbox of the Club-room. It is of large
size, and fine tortoiseshell; upon the lid, in high relief, in
silver, are the portraits of Charles I. and Queen Anne;
the Boscobel oak, with Charles II. amid its branches;
and at the foot of the tree, on a silver plate, is inscribed
Thomas Haines. At Will's the small wits grew conceited
if they dipped but into Mr. Dryden's snuffbox;
and at Tom's the box may have enjoyed a similar shrine-like
reputation. It is nearly all that remains of the
old coffee-house in Covent Garden, save the recollection
of the names of the interesting personages who once
thronged its rooms in stars and garters, but who bore
more intellectual distinctions to entitle them to remembrance.

<h2>THE KING OF CLUBS.</h2>

<p>This ambitious title was given to a Club set on foot
about the year 1801. Its founder was Bobus Smith,
the brother of the great Sydney Smith. The Club at
first consisted of a small knot of lawyers, a few literary
characters, and visitors generally introduced by those
who took the chief part in the conversation, and seemingly
selected for the faculty of being good listeners.</p>

<p>The King of Clubs sat on Saturday of each month,
at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the Strand, which,
at that time, was a nest of boxes, each containing its
Club, and affording excellent cheer, though latterly desecrated
by indifferent dinners and very questionable
wine. The Club was a grand talk, the prevalent topics
being books and authors; politics quite excluded. Bobus
Smith was a convivial member in every respect but that
of wine; he was but a frigid worshipper of Bacchus, but
he had great humour and a species of wit, that revelled
amidst the strangest and most grotesque combinations.
His manner was somewhat of the bow-wow
kind; and when he pounced upon a disputatious and
dull blockhead, he made sad work of him.</p>

<p>Then there was Richard Sharp, a partner of Boddington's
West India house, who subsequently sat in Parliament
for Port Arlington, in Ireland. He was a
thinker and a reasoner, and occasionally controversial,
but overflowed with useful and agreeable knowledge,
and an unfailing stream of delightful information. He
was celebrated for his conversational talents, and hence
called "Conversation Sharp;" and he often had for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
guest Sir James Mackintosh, with whom he lived in
habits of intimacy. Mr. Sharp published a volume of
<i>Letters and Essays in Prose and Verse</i>, of which a third
edition appeared in 1834. Sharp was confessedly the
first of the King of Clubs. He indulged but rarely in
pleasantry; but when anything of the kind escaped him,
it was sure to tell. One evening, at the Club, there was
a talk about Tweddel, then a student in the Temple,
who had greatly distinguished himself at Cambridge,
and was the Senior Wrangler and medallist of his year.
Tweddel was not a little intoxicated with his University
triumphs; which led Sharp to remark, "Poor fellow!
he will soon find that his Cambridge medal will not
pass as current coin in London." Other frequent attendants
were Scarlett (afterwards Lord Abinger); Rogers,
the poet; honest John Allen, brother of the bluest
of the blues, Lady Mackintosh; M. Dumont, the French
emigrant, who would sometimes recite his friend the
Abbé de Lisle's verses, with interminable perseverance,
in spite of yawns and other symptoms of dislike, which
his own politeness (for he was a highly-bred man) forbade
him to interpret into the absence of it in others.</p>

<p>In this respect, however, he was outdone by Wishart,
who was nothing but quotations, and whose prosing,
when he did converse, was like the torpedo's touch to all
pleasing and lively converse. Charles Butler, too, in his
long life, had treasured up a considerable assortment of
reminiscences, which, when once set going, came out like
a torrent upon you; it was a sort of shower-bath, that
inundated you the moment you pulled the string.</p>

<p>Curran, the boast of the Irish bar, came to the King
of Clubs, during a short visit to London; there he met
Erskine, but the meeting was not congenial. Curran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
gave some odd sketches of a Serjeant Kelly, at the Irish
bar, whose whimsical peculiarity was an inveterate habit
of drawing conclusions directly at variance with his premises.
He had acquired the name of Counsellor Therefore.
Curran said he was a perfect human personification
of a <i>non sequitur</i>. For instance, meeting Curran, on
Sunday, near St. Patrick's, he said to him, "The Archbishop
gave us an excellent discourse this morning. It
was well written and well delivered; <i>therefore</i>, I shall
make a point of being at the Four Courts to-morrow at
ten." At another time, observing to a person whom he
met in the street, "What a delightful morning this is
for walking!" he finished his remark on the weather by
saying, "Therefore I will go home as soon as I can, and
stir out no more the whole day." His speeches in Court
were interminable, and his <i>therefore</i> kept him going on,
though every one thought he had done. "This is so
clear a point, gentlemen," he would tell the jury, "that
I am convinced you felt it to be so the very moment I
stated it. I should pay your understandings but a poor
compliment to dwell on it for a minute; <i>therefore</i>, I will
now proceed to explain it to you as minutely as possible."</p>

<p>Curran seemed to have no very profound respect for
the character and talents of Lord Norbury. Curran
went down to Carlow on a special retainer; it was in a
case of ejectment. A new Court-house had been recently
erected, and it was found extremely inconvenient, from
the echo, which reverberated the mingled voices of judge,
counsel, crier, to such a degree, as to produce constant
confusion, and great interruption of business. Lord
Norbury had been, if possible, more noisy that morning
than ever. Whilst he was arguing a point with the counsel,
and talking very loudly, an ass brayed vehemently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
from the street, adjoining the Court-house, to the instant
interruption of the Chief-Justice. "What noise is
that?" exclaimed his Lordship. "Oh, my Lord," retorted
Curran, "it is merely the echo of the Court."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>WATIER'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>This Club was the great Macao gambling-house of a
very short period. Mr. Thomas Raikes, who understood
all its mysteries, describes it as very genteel, adding that
no one ever quarrelled there. "The Club did not endure
for twelve years altogether; the pace was too quick to
last: it died a natural death in 1819, from the paralysed
state of its members; the house was then taken by a
set of blacklegs, who instituted a common bank for gambling.
To form an idea of the ruin produced by this
short-lived establishment among men whom I have so
intimately known, a cursory glance to the past suggests
the following melancholy list, which only forms a part of
its deplorable results.... None of the dead reached the
average age of man."</p>

<p>Among the members was Bligh, a notorious madman,
of whom Mr. Raikes relates:&mdash;"One evening at the
Macao table, when the play was very deep, Brummell
having lost a considerable stake, affected, in his farcical
way, a very tragic air, and cried out, 'Waiter, bring me
a flat candlestick and a pistol.' Upon which Bligh, who
was sitting opposite to him, calmly produced two loaded
pistols from his coat pocket, which he placed on the
table, and said, 'Mr. Brummell, if you are really desirous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
to put a period to your existence, I am extremely
happy to offer you the means without troubling the
waiter.' The effect upon those present may easily be
imagined, at finding themselves in the company of a
known madman who had loaded weapons about him."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>MR. CANNING AT THE CLIFFORD-STREET
CLUB.</h2>

<p>There was in the last century, a debating Club, which
boasted for a short time, a brighter assemblage of talent
than is usually found to flourish in societies of this description.
Its meetings, which took place once a month,
were held at the Clifford-street Coffee-house, at the corner
of Bond-street. The debaters were chiefly Mackintosh,
Richard Sharp, a Mr. Ollyett Woodhouse; Charles
Moore, son of the celebrated traveller; and Lord Charles
Townshend, fourth son of the facetious and eccentric
Marquis. The great primitive principles of civil government
were then much discussed. It was before the
French Revolution had "brought death into the world
and all its woe."</p>

<p>At the Clifford-street Society, Canning generally took
"the liberal side" of the above questions. His earliest
prepossessions are well known to have inclined to this
side; but he evidently considered the Society rather as a
school of rhetorical exercise, where he might acquire the
use of his weapons, than a forum, where the serious profession
of opinions, and a consistent adherence to them,
could be fairly expected of him. One evening, the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
for debate was "the justice and expediency of resuming
the ecclesiastical property of France." Before the debate
began, Canning had taken some pains to ascertain
on which side the majority of the members seemed
inclined to speak; and finding that they were generally
in favour of the resumption, he expressed his fears
that the unanimity of sentiment would spoil the discussion;
so, he volunteered to speak against it. He did so,
and it was a speech of considerable power, chiefly in reply
to the opener, who, in a set discourse of some length,
had asserted the revocable conditions of the property of
the church, which, being created, he said, by the state,
remained ever after at its disposition. Canning denied
the proposition that ecclesiastical property was the creature
of the state. He contended that though it might
be so in a new government, yet, speaking historically, the
great as well as lesser ecclesiastical fiefs were coeval with
the crown of France, frequently strong enough to maintain
fierce and not unequal conflicts with it, and certainly
not in their origin emanations from its bounty. The
church, he said, came well dowered to the state, who was
now suing for a divorce, in order to plunder her pin-money.
He contended that the church property stood
upon the same basis, and ought to be protected by the
same sanctions, as private property. It was originally, he
said, accumulated from the successive donations with
which a pious benevolence ought to enrich the fountains,
from which spiritual comfort ought to flow to the wretched,
the poor, the forsaken. He drew an energetic sketch
of Mirabeau, the proposer of the measure, by whose side,
he remarked, the worst characters in history, the Cleons,
the Catilines, the Cetheguses, of antiquity, would brighten
into virtue. He said that the character of the lawgiver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
tainted the law. It was proffered to the National Assembly
by hands hot and reeking from the cells of sensuality and
vice; it came from a brain inflamed and distended into
frenzy by habitual debauchery. These are, of course, but
faint sketches of this very early specimen of Canning as
a speaker. The humour and irony with which he delighted
his auditors are indescribable. He displayed the same
powers of pleasantry which, in maturer years, enlivened
the dulness of debate, and softened the asperities of party.
He was, indeed, less rapid, and more measured in his
elevation; sometimes impeded in flow, probably, from
too fastidious a selection of words; but it was impossible
not to predict that at no very distant period he would
rise into high distinction as a parliamentary speaker.</p>

<p>Canning was then the most handsome man about town;
and his fine countenance glowed, as he spoke, with every
sentiment which he uttered. It was customary during
the debates at the Clifford-street Senate, for pots of porter
to be introduced by way of refreshment. Canning, in
his eloquent tirade against Mirabeau, handled the peculiar
style of the Count's oratory with great severity.
The president had, during this part of Canning's speech,
given a signal for a pot of porter, which had been brought
in and placed before him. It served Canning for an illustration.
"Sir," said he, "much has been said about
the gigantic powers of Mirabeau; let us not be carried
away by the false jargon of his philosophy, or imagine
that deep political wisdom resides in tumid and decorated
diction. To the steady eye of a sagacious criticism,
the eloquence of Mirabeau will appear to be as empty
and vapid as his patriotism. It is like the beverage that
stands so invitingly before you,&mdash;foam and froth at the
top, heavy and muddy within."

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>ECCENTRIC CLUBS.</h2>

<p>In Ward's <i>Secret History</i>, we read of the Golden
Fleece Club, a rattle-brained society, originally held at
a house in Cornhill, so entitled. They were a merry
company of tippling citizens and jocular change-brokers,
who every night washed away their consciences with
claret, that the mental alienations and fallacious assurances
the one had used in their shops, and the deceitful
wheedling and stock-jobbing honesty by which the other
had outwitted their merchants, might be no impediment
to their night's rest; but that they might sleep without
repentance, and rise next day with a strong propensity
to the same practices. Each member on his admission
had a characteristic name assigned to him; as, Sir
Timothy Addlepate, Sir Nimmy Sneer, Sir Talkative
Do-little, Sir Skinny Fretwell, Sir Rumbus Rattle, Sir
Boozy Prate-all, Sir Nicholas Ninny Sipall, Sir Gregory
Growler, Sir Pay-little, etc. The Club flourished until
the decease of the leading member; when the dull fraternity,
for want of a merry leader, and neglecting to
be shaved and blooded, fell into the dumps, gave up
their nocturnal revels, forsook frenzied claret for sober
water-gruel, and a cessation of bumpers was proclaimed,
till those who were sick recovered their health, and
others their senses; and then, the better to prevent
their debasement being known, they adjourned their Society
from the Fleece in Cornhill to the Three Tuns in
Southwark, that they might be more retired from the
bows and compliments of the London apprentices, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
used to salute the noble knights by their titles, as they
passed to and fro.</p>

<p>Another of Ward's humorous Sketches is that of the
Lying Club, at the Bell Tavern, in Westminster, with
Sir Harry Blunt for its chairman.</p>

<p>The Clubs were fruitful sources of satire to the <i>Spectator</i>.
He is merry on the Mummers, the Twopenny,
the Ugly, the Fighting, the Fringe-Glove, the Humdrum,
the Doldrum, and the Lovers; on Clubs of Fat Men,
Tall Men, and One-Eyed Men, and of Men who lived in
the same Street.</p>

<p>The pretentious character of the Clubs of Queen
Anne's time, and the historical importance attached
to their annals, are humorously satirized in the following
sketch of the Everlasting Club, to which, in those
days, if a man were an idle, worthless fellow, who neglected
his family, and spent most of his time over a
bottle, he was, in derision, said to belong.</p>

<p>"The Everlasting Club consists of an hundred members,
who divide the whole twenty-four hours among
them in such a manner, that the Club sits day and night
from one end of the year to another: no party presuming
to rise till they are relieved by those who are in course
to succeed them. By this means, a member of the
Everlasting Club never wants company; for though he
is not upon duty himself, he is sure to find some who
are; so that if he be disposed to take a whet, a nooning,
an evening's draught, or a bottle after midnight, he goes
to the Club, and finds a knot of friends to his mind.</p>

<p>"It is a maxim in this Club that the Steward never
dies; for as they succeed one another by way of rotation,
no man is to quit the great elbow-chair, which stands
at the upper end of the table, till his successor is ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
to fill it; insomuch that there has not been a <i>sede
vacante</i> in their memory.</p>

<p>"This Club was instituted towards the end, or, as some
of them say, about the middle of the Civil Wars, and
continued with interruption till the time of the Great
Fire, which burnt them out and dispersed them for
several weeks. The Steward all that time maintained his
post till he had like to have been blown up with a
neighbouring house, which was demolished in order to
stop the fire: and would not leave the chair at last, till
he had emptied the bottles upon the table, and received
repeated directions from the Club to withdraw himself.
This Steward is frequently talked of in the Club, and
looked upon by every member of it as a greater man
than the famous captain mentioned in my Lord Clarendon,
who was burnt in his ship, because he would not
quit it without orders. It is said that towards the close
of 1700, being the great year of jubilee, the Club had
it under consideration whether they should break up or
continue their session; but after many speeches and
debates, it was at length agreed to sit out the other
century. This resolution passed in a general club
<i>nemine contradicente</i>.</p>

<p>"It appears, by their books in general, that, since their
first institution, they have smoked fifty tons of tobacco,
drank thirty thousand butts of ale, one thousand hogsheads
of red port, two hundred barrels of brandy, and
<i>one</i> kilderkin of small beer. There had been likewise a
great consumption of cards. It is also said that they
observe the law in Ben Jonson's Club, which orders
the fire to be always kept in (<i>focus perennis esto</i>), as well
for the convenience of lighting their pipes as to cure
the dampness of the club-room. They have an old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
woman, in the nature of a vestal, whose business is to
cherish and perpetuate the fire, which burns from generation
to generation, and has seen the glass-house fires
in and out above an hundred times.</p>

<p>"The Everlasting Club treats all other clubs with an
eye of contempt, and talks even of the Kit-Kat and
October as a couple of upstarts. Their ordinary discourse,
as much I have been able to learn of it, turns altogether
upon such adventures as have passed in their own
assembly; of members who have taken the glass in their
turns for a week together, without stirring out of the
Club; of others who have not missed their morning's
draught for twenty years together; sometimes they
speak in rapture of a run of ale in King Charles's reign;
and sometimes reflect with astonishment upon games at
whist, which have been miraculously recovered by members
of the Society, when in all human probability the
case was desperate.</p>

<p>"They delight in several old catches, which they sing
at all hours, to encourage one another to moisten their
clay, and grow immortal by drinking, with many other
edifying exhortations of the like nature.</p>

<p>"There are four general Clubs held in a year, at which
time they fill up vacancies, appoint waiters, confirm the
old fire-maker or elect a new one, settle contributions
for coals, pipes, tobacco, and other necessaries.</p>

<p>"The senior member has outlived the whole Club
twice over, and has been drunk with the grandfathers of
some of the sitting members."</p>

<p><i>The Lawyer's Club</i> is thus described in the <i>Spectator</i>,
No. 372:&mdash;"This Club consists only of attorneys, and at
this meeting every one proposes to the board the cause
he has then in hand, upon which each member gives his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
judgment, according to the experience he has met with.
If it happens that any one puts a case of which they
have had no precedent, it is noted down by their chief
clerk, Will Goosequill (who registers all their proceedings),
that one of them may go with it next day to a
counsel. This is, indeed, commendable, and ought to
be the principal end of their meeting; but had you
been there to have heard them relate their methods of
managing a cause, their manner of drawing out their
bills, and, in short, their arguments upon the several
ways of abusing their clients, with the applause that is
given to him who has done it most artfully, you would
before now have given your remarks.</p>

<p>"They are so conscious that their discourses ought
to be kept a secret, that they are very cautious of admitting
any person who is not in the profession. When
any who are not of the law are let in, the person who
introduces him says, he is a very honest gentleman,
and he is taken, as their cant is, to pay costs." The
writer adds, "that he is admitted upon the recommendation
of one of their principals, as a very honest, good-natured
fellow, that will never be in a plot, and only
desires to drink his bottle and smoke his pipe."</p>

<p><i>The Little Club</i>, we are told in the <i>Guardian</i>, No. 91,
began by sending invitations to those not exceeding five
feet in height, to repair to the assembly, but many sent
excuses, or pretended a non-application. They proceeded
to fit up a room for their accommodation, and in the
first place had all the chairs, stools, and tables removed,
which had served the more bulky portion of mankind
for many years, previous to which they laboured under
very great disadvantages. The President's whole person
was sunk in the elbow-chair, and when his arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
were spread over it, he appeared (to the great lessening
of his dignity) like a child in a go-cart. It was also so
wide in the seat, as to give a wag occasion of saying,
that "notwithstanding the President sat in it, there was
a <i>sede vacante</i>." "The table was so high, that one who
came by chance to the door, seeing our chins just above
the pewter dishes, took us for a circle of men that sat
ready to be shaved, and set in half-a-dozen of barbers.
Another time, one of the Club spoke contumeliously of
the President, imagining he had been absent, when he
was only eclipsed by a flask of Florence, which stood on
the table, in a parallel line before his face. We therefore
new-furnished the room, in all respects proportionably
to us, and had the door made lower, so as to
admit no man above five feet high, without brushing his
foretop; which, whoever does, is utterly unqualified to
sit amongst us."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel, in his <i>Merrie England in the Olden Time</i>,
has collected a further list of Clubs existing in London
in 1790. He enumerates the following:&mdash;The Odd
Fellows' Club; the Humbugs (held at the Blue Posts, in
Covent-Garden); the Samsonic Society; the Society of
Bucks; the Purl Drinkers; the Society of Pilgrims (held
at the Woolpack, in the Kingsland-road); the Thespian
Club; the Great Bottle Club; the Je ne sçai quoi Club
(held at the Star and Garter in Pall-Mall, and of which
the Prince of Wales, and the Dukes of York, Clarence,
Orleans, Norfolk, Bedford, etc., were members); the
Sons of the Thames Society; the Blue Stocking Club;
the No Pay No Liquor Club (held at the Queen
and Artichoke, in the Hampstead-road, and of which
the ceremony, on a new member's introduction, was,
after his paying a fee on entrance of one shilling, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
he should wear a hat, throughout the first evening, made
in the shape of a quart pot, and drink to the health of
his brother members in a gilt goblet of ale); the Social
Villagers (held at the Bedford Arms, in Camden-town),
etc. Of the Villagers of our time, Sheridan Knowles,
the dramatist, was a jovial member.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>JACOBITE CLUB.</h2>

<p>In the year 1854 a Correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>
communicated to that journal the following interesting
reminiscences of a political Club, with characteristics of
the reminiscent.</p>

<p>"The adherents of the Stuarts are now nearly extinct;
but I recollect a few years ago an old gentleman
in London, who was then upwards of eighty years of
age, and who was a staunch Jacobite. I have heard
him say that, when he was a young man, his father
belonged to a society in Aldersgate-street, called 'The
Mourning Bush;' and this Bush was to be always in
mourning until the Stuarts were restored." A member
of this society having been met in mourning when one
of the reigning family had died, was asked by one of the
members how it so happened? His reply was, "that he
was not mourning for the dead, but for the living."
The old gentleman was father of the Mercers' Company,
and his brother of the Stationers' Company: they
were bachelors, and citizens of the old school, hospitable,
liberal, and charitable. An instance occurred that
the latter had a presentation to Christ's Hospital: he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
was applied to in behalf of a person who had a large
family; but the father not being a freeman, he could
not present it to the son. He immediately bought the
freedom for the father, and gave the son the presentation.
This is a rare act. The brothers have long gone
to receive the reward of their goodness, and lie buried in
the cemetery attached to Mercers' Hall, Cheapside.</p>

<p>By the above statement, the Club appears to have
taken the name of the Mourning Bush Tavern, in Aldersgate,
of which we shall have more to say hereafter.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE WITTINAGEMOT OF THE CHAPTER
COFFEE-HOUSE.</h2>

<p>The Chapter Coffee-house, at the corner of Chapterhouse
Court, on the south side of Paternoster-row, was,
in the last century, noted as the resort of men of letters,
and was famous for its punch, pamphlets, and good supply
of newspapers. It was closed as a coffee-house in
1854, and then altered to a tavern. Its celebrity, however,
lay in the last century. In the <i>Connoisseur</i>,
January 31, 1754, we read: "The Chapter Coffee-house
is frequented by those encouragers of literature, and (as
they are styled by an eminent critic) 'not the worst
judges of merit,' the booksellers. The conversation
here naturally turns upon the newest publications; but
their criticisms are somewhat singular. When they say
a <i>good</i> book, they do not mean to praise the style or
sentiment, but the quick and extensive sale of it. That
book is best which sells most; and if the demand for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Quarles should be greater than for Pope, he would have
the highest place on the rubric-post."</p>

<p>The house was much frequented by Chatterton, who
writes to his mother: "I am quite familiar at the
Chapter Coffee-house, and know all the geniuses there;"
and to Mr. Mason: "Send me whatever you would
have published, and direct for me, to be left at the
Chapter Coffee-house, Paternoster-row." And, writing
from "King's Bench for the present," May 14th, 1770,
Chatterton says: "A gentleman who knows me at the
Chapter, as an author, would have introduced me as a
companion to the young Duke of Northumberland, in
his intended general tour. But, alas! I spake no tongue
but my own."</p>

<p>Forster relates an anecdote of Oliver Goldsmith being
paymaster at the Chapter, for Churchill's friend, Lloyd,
who, in his careless way, without a shilling to pay for
the entertainment, had invited him to sup with some
friends of Grub-street.</p>

<p>The Club celebrity of the Chapter was, however, the
Wittinagemot, as the box in the north-east corner of the
coffee-room was designated. Among its frequenters was
Alexander Stevens, editor of the <i>Annual Biography and
Obituary</i>, who died in 1824, and who left among his
papers, printed in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, as "Stephensiana,"
his recollections of the Chapter, which he frequented
in 1797 to 1805, where, he tells us, he always
met with intelligent company. We give his reminiscences
almost in his own words.</p>

<p>Early in the morning it was occupied by neighbours,
who were designated the <i>Wet Paper Club</i>, as it was
their practice to open the papers when brought in by
the newsmen, and read them before they were dried by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the waiter; a dry paper they viewed as a stale commodity.
In the afternoon, another party enjoyed the <i>wet</i>
evening papers; and (says Stephens) it was these whom
I met.</p>

<p>Dr. Buchan, author of <i>Domestic Medicine</i>, generally
held a seat in this box; and though he was a Tory, he
heard the freest discussion with good humour, and commonly
acted as a moderator. His fine physiognomy,
and his white hairs, qualified him for this office. But
the fixture in the box was a Mr. Hammond, a Coventry
manufacturer, who, evening after evening, for nearly
forty-five years, was always to be found in his place,
and during the entire period was much distinguished for
his severe and often able strictures on the events of the
day. He had thus debated through the days of Wilkes,
of the American war, and of the French war, and being
on the side of liberty, was constantly in opposition. His
mode of arguing was Socratic, and he generally applied
to his adversary the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, creating bursts
of laughter.</p>

<p>The registrar or chronicler of the box was a Mr.
Murray, an episcopal Scotch minister, who generally sat
in one place from nine in the morning till nine at night;
and was famous for having read, at least once through,
every morning and evening paper published in London
during the last thirty years. His memory being good,
he was appealed to whenever any point of fact within the
memory of man happened to be disputed. It was often
remarked, however, that such incessant daily reading did
not tend to clear his views.</p>

<p>Among those from whom I constantly profited was
Dr. Berdmore, the Master of the Charterhouse; Walker,
the rhetorician; and Dr. Towers, the political and historical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
writer. Dr. B. abounded in anecdote; Walker,
(the Dictionary-maker,) to the finest enunciation united
the most intelligent head I ever met with; and Towers,
over his half-pint of Lisbon, was sarcastic and lively,
though never deep.</p>

<p>Among our constant visitors was the celebrated Dr.
George Fordyce, who, having much fashionable practice,
brought news which had not generally transpired. He
had not the appearance of a man of genius, nor did he
debate, but he possessed sound information on all subjects.
He came to the Chapter after taking his wine, and
stayed about an hour, or while he sipped a glass of brandy-and-water;
it was then his habit to take another glass
at the London Coffee-house, and a third at the Oxford,
before he returned to his house in Essex-street, Strand.</p>

<p>Dr. Gower, the urbane and able physician of the Middlesex,
was another pretty constant visitor. It was gratifying
to hear such men as Fordyce, Gower, and Buchan
in familiar chat. On subjects of medicine they seldom
agreed, and when such were started, they generally
laughed at one another's opinions. They seemed to consider
Chapter punch, or brandy-and-water, as <i>aqua vitæ</i>;
and, to the credit of the house, better punch could not
be found in London. If any one complained of being
indisposed, the elder Buchan exclaimed, "Now let me
prescribe for you without a fee. Here, John or Isaac,
bring a glass of punch for Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, unless he likes
brandy-and-water better. Take that, Sir, and I'll warrant
you you'll soon be well. You're a peg too low;
you want stimulus, and if one glass won't do, call for
a second."</p>

<p>There was a growling man of the name of Dobson,
who, when his asthma permitted, vented his spleen upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
both sides; and a lover of absurd paradoxes, author of
some works of merit, but so devoid of principle, that, deserted
by his friends, he would have died for want, if Dr.
Garthshore had not placed him as a patient in the empty
Fever Institution.</p>

<p>Robinson, the king of the booksellers, was frequently
of the party, as well as his brother John, a man of some
talent; and Joseph Johnson, the friend of Priestley, and
Paine, and Cowper, and Fuseli, came from St. Paul's
Churchyard.</p>

<p>Phillips, then commencing his <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, was
also on a keen look-out for recruits, and with his waistcoat
pocket full of guineas, to slip his enlistment money
into their hand. Phillips, in the winter of 1795-6,
lodged and boarded at the Chapter, and not only knew
the characters referred to by Mr. Stephens, but many
others equally original, from the voracious glutton in
politics, who waited for the wet papers in the morning
twilight, to the comfortless bachelor, who sat till the fire
was raked out at half-past twelve at night, all of whom
took their successive stations, like figures in a magic
lantern.</p>

<p>Alexander Chalmers, the workman of the Robinsons,
and through their introduction editor of many large
books, also enlivened the box by many sallies of wit
and humour. He always took much pains to be distinguished
from his namesake George, who, he used to
say, carried, "the leaden mace," and he was much provoked
whenever he happened to be mistaken for his
namesake.</p>

<p>Cahusac, a teacher of the classics; M'Leod, a writer
in the newspapers; the two Parrys, of the <i>Courier</i>, the
organ of Jacobinism; and Captain Skinner, a man of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
elegant manners, who personated our nation in the procession
of Anacharsis Clootz, at Paris, in 1793, were also
in constant attendance.</p>

<p>One Baker, once a Spitalfields manufacturer, a great
talker, and not less remarkable as an eater, was constant;
but, having shot himself at his lodgings in Kirby-street,
it was discovered that, for some years, he had had no
other meal per day besides the supper which he took at
the Chapter, where there being a choice of viands at the
fixed price of one shilling, this, with a pint of porter,
constituted his daily subsistence, till, his last resources
failing, he put an end to himself.</p>

<p>Lowndes, the celebrated electrician, was another of our
set, and a facetious man. Buchan the younger, a son
of the Doctor, generally came with Lowndes; and though
somewhat dogmatical, yet he added to the variety and
good intelligence of our discussions, which, from the
mixture of company, were as various as the contents of
the newspapers.</p>

<p>Dr. Busby, the musician, and an ingenious man, often
obtained a hearing, and was earnest in disputing with the
Tories. And Macfarlane, the author of the <i>History of
George the Third</i>, was generally admired for the soundness
of his views; but this worthy man was killed by the
pole of a coach, during an election procession of Sir
Francis Burdett, from Brentford. Mr. W. Cooke, author
of <i>Conversation</i>, constantly exemplified his own rules
in his gentlemanly manners and well-timed anecdotes.</p>

<p>Kelly, an Irish school-master, and a man of polished
manners, kept up warm debates by his equivocating politics,
and was often roughly handled by Hammond and
others, though he bore his defeats with constant good
humour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>There was a young man named Wilson, who acquired
the distinction of Long-bow, from the number of extraordinary
secrets of the <i>haut ton</i>, which he used to retail
by the hour. He was an amusing person, who seemed
likely to prove an acquisition to the Wittinagemot; but,
having run up a score of thirty or forty pounds, he suddenly
absented himself. Miss Brun, the keeper of the
Chapter, begged me, if I met with Wilson, to tell him
she would give him a receipt for the past, and further
credit to any amount, if he would only return to the
house; "for," said she, "if he never paid us, he was one
of the best customers we ever had, contriving, by his
stories and conversation, to keep a couple of boxes
crowded the whole night, by which we made more punch
and more brandy-and-water, than from any other single
cause whatever."</p>

<p>Jacob, afterwards an alderman and M.P., was a frequent
visitor, and then as remarkable for his heretical,
as he was subsequently for his orthodox, opinions in his
speeches and writings.</p>

<p>Waithman, the active and eloquent Common Councilman,
often mixed with us, and was always clear-headed
and agreeable. One James, who had made a large fortune
by vending tea, contributed many good anecdotes
of the age of Wilkes.</p>

<p>Several stockbrokers visited us; and among others of
that description was Mr. Blake, the banker, of Lombard-street,
a remarkably intelligent old gentleman; and
there was a Mr. Paterson, a North Briton, a long-headed
speculator, who taught mathematics to Pitt.</p>

<p>Some young men of talent came among us from time
to time; as Lovett, a militia officer; Hennell, a coal
merchant, and some others; and these seemed likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
keep up the party. But all things have an end: Dr.
Buchan died; some young sparks affronted our Nestor,
Hammond, on which he absented himself, after nearly
fifty years' attendance; and the noisy box of the
Wittinagemot was, for some years previously to 1820,
remarkable for its silence and dulness. The two or
three last times I was at the Chapter, I heard no voice
above a whisper; and I almost shed a tear on thinking
of men, habits, and times gone by for ever!</p>

<p>We shall have more to say of the Chapter Coffee-house
in Vol. II.</p>

<h2>THE ROXBURGHE CLUB DINNERS.</h2>

<p>The Roxburghe Club claims its foundation from the
sale of the library of the late John, Duke of Roxburghe,
in 1812, which extended to forty-one days following,
with a supplementary catalogue beginning Monday,
July 13, with the exception of Sundays. Some few
days before the sale, the Rev. Thomas Frognall Dibdin,
who claimed the title of founder of the Club, suggested
the holding of a convivial meeting at the St. Alban's
Tavern after the sale of June 17th, upon which day was
to be sold the rarest lot, "Il Decamerone di Boccaccio,"
which produced £2260. The invitation ran thus:&mdash;"The
honour of your company is requested, to dine with
the Roxburghe <i>dinner</i>, on Wednesday, the 17th instant."
At the first dinner the number of members was limited
to twenty-four, which at the second dinner was extended
to thirty-one. The president of this club was Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Spencer: among the other celebrated members were the
Duke of Devonshire, the Marquis of Blandford, Lord
Althorp, Lord Morpeth, Lord Gower, Sir Mark Sykes,
Sir Egerton Brydges, Mr. (afterwards) Baron Bolland,
Mr. Dent, the Rev. T. C. Heber, Rev. Rob. Holwell
Carr, Sir Walter Scott, etc.; Dr. Dibdin, secretary.</p>

<p>The avowed object of the Club was the reprinting of
rare and ancient pieces of ancient literature; and, at
one of the early meetings, "it was proposed and concluded
for each member of the Club to reprint a scarce
piece of ancient lore, to be given to the members, one
copy being on vellum for the chairman, and only as
many copies as members."</p>

<p>It may, however, be questioned whether "the dinners"
of the Club were not more important than the literature.
They were given at the St. Alban's, at Grillion's, at the
Clarendon, and the Albion, taverns; the <i>Amphytrions</i>
evincing as <i>recherché</i> taste in the <i>carte</i>, as the Club did
in their vellum reprints. Of these entertainments some
curious details have been recorded by the late Mr.
Joseph Haslewood, one of the members, in a MS. entitled,
"Roxburghe Revels; or, an Account of the
Annual Display, culinary and festivous, interspersed
incidentally with Matters of Moment or Merriment."
This MS. was, in 1833, purchased by the Editor of the
<i>Athenæum</i>, and a selection from its rarities was subsequently
printed in that journal. Among the memoranda,
we find it noted that, at the second dinner, a few
tarried, with Mr. Heber in the chair, until, "on arriving
at home, the click of time bespoke a quarter to four."
Among the early members was the Rev. Mr. Dodd, one
of the masters of Westminster School, who, until the
year 1818 (when he died), enlivened the Club with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Robin-Hood ditties and similar productions. The fourth
dinner was given at Grillion's, when twenty members
assembled, under the chairmanship of Sir Mark Masterman
Sykes. The bill on this occasion amounted to
£57, or £2. 17<i>s.</i> per man; and the twenty "lions"
managed to dispose of drinkables to the extent of about
£33. The reckoning, by Grillion's French waiter, is
amusing:&mdash;</p>

<p>The anniversary of 1818 was celebrated at the Albion,
in Aldersgate-street: Mr. Heber was in the chair, and
the Rev. Mr. Carr <i>vice</i>, vice Dr. Dibdin. Although
only fifteen sat down, they seem to have eaten and drunk
for the whole Club: it was, as Wordsworth says, "forty
feeding like one;" and the bill, at the conclusion of the
night, amounted to £85. 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> "Your cits," says
Mr. Haslewood, "are the only men for a feast; and,
therefore, behold us, like locusts, travelling to devour
the good things of the land, eastward ho! At a little
after seven, with our fancies much delighted, we fifteen
sat down."

<p>"Consider, in the bird's-eye view of the banquet,
(says Mr. Haslewood,) the trencher cuts, foh! nankeen
displays; as intersticed with many a brilliant drop to
friendly beck and clubbish hail, to moisten the viands,
or cool the incipient cayenne. No unfamished liveryman
would desire better dishes, or high-tasted courtier
better wines. With men that meet to commune, that
can converse, and each willing to give and receive information,
more could not be wanting to promote well-tempered
conviviality; a social compound of mirth, wit,
and wisdom;&mdash;combining all that Anacreon was famed
for, tempered with the reason of Demosthenes, and
intersected with the archness of Scaliger. It is true we
had not any Greek verses in praise of the grape; but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
had as a tolerable substitute the ballad of the Bishop of
Hereford and Robin Hood, sung by Mr. Dodd; and it
was of his own composing. It is true we had not any
long oration denouncing the absentees, the Cabinet
council, or any other set of men, but there was not a
man present that at one hour and seventeen minutes
after the cloth was removed but could not have made a
Demosthenic speech far superior to any record of antiquity.
It is true no trait of wit is going to be here preserved,
for the flashes were too general; and what is the
critical sagacity of Scaliger, compared to our chairman?
Ancients, believe it we were not dead drunk, and therefore
lie quiet under the table for once, and let a few
moderns be uppermost.</p>

Haslewood says, with characteristic sprightliness:
"Twenty-one members met joyfully, dined comfortably,
challenged eagerly, tippled prettily, divided regretfully,
and paid the bill most cheerfully."</p>

The Cause of Bibliomania all over the World.</p>

<p class="p2">To show that the pursuits of the Roxburghe Club
have been estimated with a difference, we quote what
may be termed "another side of the question":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among other follies of the age of paper, which took
place in England at the end of the reign of George III.,
a set of book-fanciers, who had more money than wit,
formed themselves into a club, and appropriately designated
themselves the <i>Bibliomaniacs</i>. Dr. Dibdin was
their organ; and among the club were several noblemen,
who, in other respects, were esteemed men of
sense. Their rage was, not to estimate books according
to their intrinsic worth, but for their rarity. Hence,
any volume of the vilest trash, which was scarce, merely
because it never had any sale, fetched fifty or a hundred
pounds; but if it were but one of two or three known
copies, no limits could be set to the price. Books
altered in the title-page, or in a leaf, or any trivial circumstance
which varied a few copies, were bought by
these <i>soi-disant</i> maniacs, at one, two, or three hundred
pounds, though the copies were not really worth more
than threepence per pound. A trumpery edition of
Boccaccio, said to be one of two known copies, was thus
bought by a noble marquis for £1475, though in two or
three years afterwards he resold it for £500. First
editions of all authors, and editions by the first clumsy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
printers, were never sold for less than £50, £100, or
£200.</p>

<p>"To keep each other in countenance, these persons
formed themselves into a club, and, after a Duke, one of
their fraternity, called themselves the <i>Roxburghe Club</i>.
To gratify them, <i>facsimile</i> copies of clumsy editions of
trumpery books were reprinted; and, in some cases, it
became worth the while of more ingenious persons to
play off forgeries upon them. This mania after awhile
abated and, in future ages, it will be ranked with the
tulip and the picture mania, during which, estates were
given for single flowers and pictures."</p>

<p>The Roxburghe Club still exists; and, with the Dilettanti
Society, may justly be said to have suggested the
Publishing Societies of the present day, at the head of
which is the Camden. The late Duke of Devonshire
was a munificent member of the Roxburghe.</p>

<h2>THE SOCIETY OF PAST OVERSEERS,
WESTMINSTER.</h2>

<p>There are several parochial Clubs in the metropolis;
but that of the important parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster,
with "Past Overseers" for its members, has
signalized itself by the <i>accumulation</i> and preservation of
an unique heirloom, which is a very curious collection
of memorials of the last century and a half, exhibiting
various tastes and styles of art in their respective commemorations,
in a sort of <i>chronology in silver</i>.</p>

<p>Such is the St. Margaret's Overseer's Box, which
originated as follows. It appears that a Mr. Monck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
purchased, at Horn Fair, held at Charlton, Kent, a small
tobacco-box for the sum of fourpence, from which he
often replenished his neighbour's pipe, at the meetings
of his predecessors and companions in the office of
Overseers of the Poor, to whom the Box was presented
in 1713. In 1720, the Society of Past Overseers ornamented
the lid with a silver rim, commemorating the
donor. In 1726, a silver side case and bottom were
added. In 1740, an embossed border was placed upon
the lid, and the under part enriched with an emblem of
Charity. In 1746, Hogarth engraved inside the lid a
bust of the Duke of Cumberland, with allegorical figures,
and scroll commemorating the Battle of Culloden. In
1765, an interwoven scroll was added to the lid, enclosing
a plate with the arms of the City of Westminster, and
inscribed: "This Box to be delivered to every succeeding
set of Overseers, on penalty of five guineas."</p>

<p>The original Horn box being thus ornamented, additional
cases were provided by the Senior Overseers for
the time being,&mdash;namely, silver plates engraved with
emblematical and historical subjects and busts. Among
the first are a View of the Fireworks in St. James's
Park, to celebrate the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1749;
Admiral Keppel's Action off Ushant, and his acquittal
after a court-martial; the Battle of the Nile; the Repulse
of Admiral Linois, 1804; the Battle of Trafalgar,
1805; the Action between the San Fiorenzo and La
Piémontaise, 1808; the Battle of Waterloo, 1815; the
Bombardment of Algiers, 1816; View of the House of
Lords at the Trial of Queen Caroline; the Coronation
of George IV.; and his Visit to Scotland, 1822.</p>

<p>There are also&mdash;Portraits of John Wilkes, Churchwarden
in 1759; Nelson, Duncan, Howe, Vincent; Fox
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and Pitt, 1806; George IV. as Prince Regent, 1811;
the Princess Charlotte, 1817; and Queen Charlotte,
1818. But the more interesting representations are
those of local circumstances; as the Interior of Westminster
Hall, with the Westminster Volunteers, attending
Divine Service at the drum-head on the Fast Day,
1803; the Old Sessions House; a view of St. Margaret's,
from the north-east; and the West Front
Tower, and altar-piece. In 1813, a large silver plate
was added to the outer case, with a portrait of the Duke
of Wellington, commemorating the centenary of the agglomeration
of the Box.</p>

<p>The top of the second case represents the Governors
of the Poor, in their Board-room, and this inscription:
"The original Box and cases to be given to every succeeding
set of Overseers, on penalty of fifty guineas,
1783." On the outside of the first case is a clever
engraving of a cripple.</p>

<p>In 1785, Mr. Gilbert exhibited the Box to some
friends after dinner: at night, thieves broke in, and
carried off all the plate that had been in use; but the
box had been removed beforehand to a bedchamber.</p>

<p>In 1793, Mr. Read, a Past Overseer, detained the
Box, because his accounts were not passed. An action
was brought for its recovery, which was long delayed,
owing to two members of the Society giving Read a
release, which he successfully pleaded in bar to the
action. This rendered it necessary to take proceedings
in equity: accordingly, a Bill was filed in Chancery
against all three, and Read was compelled to deposit the
box with Master Leeds until the end of the suit. Three
years of litigation ensued. Eventually the Chancellor
directed the Box to be restored to the Overseers' Society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
and Mr. Read paid in costs £300. The extra
costs amounted to £76. 13<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, owing to the illegal
proceedings of Mr. Read. The sum of £91. 7<i>s.</i> was
at once raised; and the surplus spent upon a third case,
of octagon shape. The top records the triumph: Justice
trampling upon a prostrate man, from whose face a
mask falls upon a writhing serpent. A second plate, on
the outside of the fly-lid, represents the Lord Chancellor
Loughborough, pronouncing his decree for the restoration
of the Box, March 5, 1796.</p>

<p>On the fourth or outer case is the Anniversary Meeting
of the Past Overseers' Society, with the Churchwardens
giving the charge previous to delivering the Box
to the succeeding Overseer, who is bound to produce it
at certain parochial entertainments, with three pipes of
tobacco at the least, under the penalty of six bottles of
claret; and to return the whole, with some addition,
safe and sound, under a penalty of 200 guineas.</p>

<p>A tobacco-stopper of mother-of-pearl, with a silver
chain, is enclosed within the Box, and completes this
unique Memorial of the kindly feeling which perpetuates
year by year the old ceremonies of this united parish;
and renders this traditionary piece of plate of great
price, far outweighing its intrinsic value.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h2>THE ROBIN HOOD.</h2>

<p>In the reign of George the Second there met, at a
house in Essex-street, in the Strand, the Robin Hood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Society, a debating Club, at which, every Monday, questions
were proposed, and any member might speak on
them for seven minutes; after which the "baker," who
presided with a hammer in his hand, summed up the
arguments. Arthur Mainwaring and Dr. Hugh Chamberlain
were among the earliest members of this Society.
Horace Walpole notices the Robin Hood as one of the
celebrities which Monsieur Beaumont <i>saw</i> in 1761: "it
is incredible," says Walpole, "what pains he has taken
to <i>see</i>:" he breakfasted at Strawberry Hill with Walpole,
who was then "as much a curiosity to all foreigners
as the tombs and lions."</p>

<p>The Robin Hood became famous as the scene of
Burke's earliest eloquence. To discipline themselves in
public speaking at its meetings was then the custom
among law-students, and others intended for public life;
and it is said that at the Robin Hood, Burke had commonly
to encounter an opponent whom nobody else could
overcome, or at least silence: this person was the president.
Oliver Goldsmith was introduced to the Club
by Samuel Derrick, his acquaintance and countryman.
Struck by the eloquence and imposing aspect of the president,
who sat in a large gilt chair, Goldsmith thought
Nature had meant him for a lord chancellor: "No, no,"
whispered Derrick, who knew him to be a wealthy baker
from the City, "only for a master of the rolls." Goldsmith
was little of an orator; but, till Derrick went
away to succeed Beau Nash at Bath, seems to have continued
his visits, and even spoke occasionally; for he
figures in an account of the members published at about
this time, as "a candid disputant, with a clear head and
an honest heart, though coming but seldom to the
Society."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>One of the members of this Robin Hood was Peter
Annet, a man who, though ingenious and deserving in
other respects, became unhappily notorious by a kind of
fanatic crusade against the Bible, for which (published
weekly papers against the Book of Genesis,) he stood
twice in one year in the pillory, and then underwent imprisonment
in the King's Bench. To Annet's room
in that prison went Goldsmith, taking with him Newbery,
the publisher, to conclude the purchase of a Child's
Grammar from the prisoner, hoping so to relieve his distress;
but on the prudent publisher suggesting that no
name should appear on the title-page, and Goldsmith
agreeing that circumstances made this advisable, Annet
accused them both of cowardice, and rejected their assistance
with contempt.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE BLUE-STOCKING CLUB.</h2>

<p>The earliest mention of a Blue-Stocking, or <i>Bas-Bleu</i>,
occurs in the Greek comedy, entitled the <i>Banquet of
Plutarch</i>. The term, as applied to a lady of high literary
taste, has been traced by Mills, in his <i>History of Chivalry</i>,
to the Society de la Calza, formed at Venice, in 1400,
"when, consistently with the singular custom of the
Italians, of marking academies and other intellectual
associations by some external sign of folly, the members,
when they met in literary discussion, were distinguished
by the colour of their stockings. The colours were
sometimes fantastically blended; and at other times one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
colour, particularly <i>blue</i>, prevailed." The Society de la
Calza lasted till 1590, when the foppery of Italian literature
took some other symbol. The rejected title then
crossed the Alps, and found a congenial soil in Parisian
society, and particularly branded female pedantry. It
then diverted from France to England, and for awhile
marked the vanity of the small advances in literature in
female coteries.</p>

<p>But the <i>Blue-stocking</i> of the last century is of home-growth;
for Boswell, in his <i>Life of Johnson</i>, date 1781,
records: "About this time it was much the fashion for
several ladies to have evening assemblies, where the fair
sex might participate in conversation with literary and
ingenious men, animated by a desire to please. One of
the most eminent members of these societies, when they
first commenced, was Mr. Stillingfleet (grandson of the
Bishop), whose dress was remarkably grave; and in particular
it was observed that he wore blue stockings.
Such was the excellence of his conversation, that his
absence was felt so great a loss that it used to be said,
'We can do nothing without the <i>blue stockings</i>;'" and
thus by degrees the title was established. Miss Hannah
More has admirably described a <i>Blue-Stocking Club</i>, in
her <i>Bas-Bleu</i>, a poem in which many of the persons who
were most conspicuous there are mentioned. And
Horace Walpole speaks of this production as "a charming
poetic familiarity called 'the Blue-Stocking Club.'"</p>

<p>The Club met at the house of Mrs. Montagu, at the
north-west angle of Portman-square. Forbes, in his
<i>Life of Beattie</i>, gives another account: "This Society
consisted originally of Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Vesey, Miss
Boscawen, and Mrs. Carter, Lord Lyttelton, Mr. Pulteney,
Horace Walpole, and Mr. Stillingfleet. To the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
latter gentleman, a man of great piety and worth, and
author of some works in natural history, etc., this constellation
of talents owed that whimsical appellation of
'Bas-Bleu.' Mr. Stillingfleet being somewhat of an
humourist in his habits and manners, and a little negligent
in his dress, literally wore gray stockings; from
which circumstance Admiral Boscawen used, by way of
pleasantry, to call them 'The Blue-Stocking Society,'
as if to intimate that when these brilliant friends met,
it was not for the purpose of forming a dressed assembly.
A foreigner of distinction hearing the expression, translated
it literally 'Bas-Bleu,' by which these meetings
came to be afterwards distinguished." Dr. Johnson sometimes
joined this circle. The last of the Club was the
lively Miss Monckton, afterwards Countess of Cork,
"who used to have the finest <i>bit of blue</i> at the house of
her mother Lady Galway." Lady Cork died at upwards
of ninety years of age, at her house in New Burlington-street,
in 1840.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE IVY-LANE CLUB.</h2>

<p>This was one of the creations of Dr. Johnson's <i>clubbable</i>
nature, which served as recreation for this laborious
worker. He was now "tugging at the oar," in Gough-square,
Fleet-street. Boswell describes him as "engaged
in a steady, continued course of occupation."
"But his enlarged and lively mind could not be satisfied
without more diversity of employment, and the pleasure
of animated relaxation. He therefore not only exerted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
his talents in occasional composition, very different from
lexicography, but formed a Club in Ivy-lane, Paternoster-row,
with a view to enjoy literary discussion, and
amuse his evening hours. The members associated with
him in this little Society were his beloved friend Dr.
Richard Bathurst; Mr. Hawkesworth, afterwards well
known by his writings; Mr. John Hawkins, an attorney;
and a few others of different professions." The Club
met every Tuesday evening at the King's Head, a beef-steak
house in Ivy-lane. One of the members, Hawkins,
then Sir John, has given a very lively picture of a celebration
by this Club, at the Devil Tavern, in Fleet-street,
which forms one of the pleasantest pages in the Author's
Life of Johnson. Sir John tells us:</p>

<p>"One evening, at the [Ivy-lane] Club, Dr. Johnson
proposed to us celebrating the birth of Mrs. Lennox's
first literary child, as he called her book, by a whole
night spent in festivity. The place appointed was the
Devil Tavern; and there, about the hour of eight, Mrs.
Lennox, and her husband, and a lady of her acquaintance
now living [1785], as also the Club and friends, to
the number of near twenty, assembled. Our supper was
elegant, and Johnson had directed that a magnificent
hot apple-pye should make a part of it, and this he would
have stuck with bay-leaves, because, forsooth, Mrs.
Lennox was an authoress, and had written verses; and
further, he had prepared for her a crown of laurel, with
which, but not until he had invoked the Muses by some
ceremonies of his own invention, he encircled her brows.
The night passed, as must be imagined, in pleasant conversation
and harmless mirth, intermingled, at different
periods, with the refreshments of coffee and tea. About
five, Johnson's face shone with meridian splendour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
though his drink had been only lemonade; but the
far greater part of us had deserted the colours of Bacchus,
and were with difficulty rallied to partake of a
second refreshment of coffee, which was scarcely ended
when the day began to dawn. This phenomenon began
to put us in mind of our reckoning; but the waiters
were all so overcome with sleep, that it was two hours
before we could get a bill, and it was not till near eight
that the creaking of the street-door gave the signal for
our departure."</p>

<p>When Johnson, the year before his death, endeavoured
to re-assemble as many of the Club as were left, he found,
to his regret, he wrote to Hawkins, that Horseman, the
landlord, was dead, and the house shut up.</p>

<p>About this time, Johnson instituted a Club at the
Queen's Arms, in St. Paul's Churchyard. "He told Mr.
Hook," says Boswell, "that he wished to have <i>a City
Club</i>, and asked him to collect one; but," said he, "don't
let them be patriots." (Boswell's <i>Life</i>, 8th edit. vol. iv.
p. 93.) This was an allusion to the friends of his acquaintance
Wilkes. Boswell accompanied him one day
to the Club, and found the members "very sensible, well-behaved
men."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE ESSEX HEAD CLUB.</h2>

<p>In the year before he died, at the Essex Head, now
No. 40, in Essex-street, Strand, Dr. Johnson established a
little evening Club, under circumstances peculiarly interesting,
as described by Boswell. He tells us that "notwithstanding
the complication of disorders under which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Johnson now laboured, he did not resign himself to despondency
and discontent, but with wisdom and spirit
endeavoured to console and amuse his mind with as
many innocent enjoyments as he could procure." Sir
John Hawkins has mentioned the cordiality with which
he insisted that such of the members of the old Club in
Ivy-lane as survived, should meet again and dine together,
which they did, twice at a tavern, and once at his house;
and in order to ensure himself in the evening for three
days in the week, Johnson instituted a Club at the Essex
Head, in Essex-street, then kept by Samuel Greaves, an
old servant of Mr. Thrale's: it was called "Sam's."</p>

<p>On Dec. 4, 1783, Johnson wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds,
giving an account of this Club, of which Reynolds
had desired to be one; "the company," Dr. J. says, "is
numerous, and, as you will see by the list, miscellaneous.
The terms are lax, and the expenses light. Mr. Barry
was adopted by Dr. Brocklesby, who joined with me in
forming the plan. We meet twice a week, and he who
misses forfeits twopence." It did not suit Sir Joshua
to be one of this Club; "but," says Boswell, "when I
mention only Mr. Daines Barrington, Dr. Brocklesby,
Mr. Murphy, Mr. John Nichols, Mr. Cooke, Mr. Joddrel,
Mr. Paradise, Dr. Horsley, Mr. Windham, I shall
sufficiently obviate the misrepresentation of it by Sir John
Hawkins, as if it had been a low ale-house association, by
which Johnson was degraded." The Doctor himself, like
his namesake, Old Ben, composed the Rules of his Club.
Boswell was, at this time, in Scotland, and during all
the winter. Johnson, however, declared that he should
be a member, and invented a word upon the occasion:
"Boswell," said he, "is a very <i>clubbable</i> man;" and he
was subsequently chosen of the Club.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>Johnson headed the Rules with these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"To-day deep thoughts with me resolve to drench</p>
<p>In mirth, which after no repenting draws."&mdash;<i>Milton.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Johnson's attention to the Club was unceasing, as appears
by a letter to Alderman Clark, (afterwards Lord
Mayor and Chamberlain,) who was elected into the
Club: the postscript is: "You ought to be informed
that the forfeits began with the year, and that every
night of non-attendance incurs the mulct of three pence;
that is, ninepence a week." Johnson himself was so
anxious in his attendance, that going to meet the Club
when he was not strong enough, he was seized with a
spasmodic asthma, so violent, that he could scarcely return
home, and he was confined to his house eight or
nine weeks. He recovered by May 15, when he was in
fine spirits at the Club.</p>

<p>Boswell writes of the Essex: "I believe there are few
Societies where there is better conversation, or more
decorum. Several of us resolved to continue it after our
great founder was removed by death. Other members
were added; and now, above eight years since that loss,
we go on happily."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE LITERARY CLUB.</h2>

<p>Out of the casual, but frequent meetings of men of
talent at the hospitable board of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
in Leicester-square, rose that association of wits, authors,
scholars, and statesmen, renowned as the Literary Club.
Reynolds was the first to propose a regular association
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
of the kind, and was eagerly seconded by Johnson, who
suggested as a model the Club which he had formed some
fourteen years previously, in Ivy-lane;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and which the
deaths or dispersion of its members had now interrupted
for nearly seven years. On this suggestion being adopted,
the members, as in the earlier Club, were limited to
nine, and Mr. Hawkins, as an original member of the
Ivy-lane Club, was invited to join. Topham Beauclerk
and Bennet Langton were asked and welcomed earnestly;
and, of course, Mr. Edmund Burke. The notion of the
Club delighted Burke; and he asked admission for his
father-in-law, Dr. Nugent, an accomplished Roman
Catholic physician, who lived with him. Beauclerk, in
like manner, suggested his friend Chamier, then Under-Secretary-at-War.
Oliver Goldsmith completed the number.
But another member of the original Ivy-lane,
Samuel Dyer, making unexpected appearance from abroad,
in the following year, was joyfully admitted; and
though it was resolved to make election difficult, and
only for special reasons permit addition to their number,
the limitation at first proposed was thus, of course, done
away with. Twenty was the highest number reached in
the course of ten years.</p>

<p>The dates of the Club are thus summarily given by Mr.
Hatchett, the treasurer:&mdash;It was founded in 1764, by Sir
Joshua Reynolds and Dr. Samuel Johnson, and for some
years met on Monday evenings, at seven. In 1772, the
day of meeting was changed to Friday, and about that
time, instead of supping, they agreed to dine together
once in every fortnight during the sitting of Parliament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
In 1773, the Club, which, soon after its foundation, consisted
of twelve members, was enlarged to twenty; March
11, 1777, to twenty-six; November 27, 1778, to thirty;
May 9, 1780, to thirty-five; and it was then resolved
that it should never exceed forty. It met originally at
the Turk's Head, in Gerard-street, and continued to
meet there till 1783, when their landlord died, and the
house was soon afterwards shut up. They then removed
to Prince's, in Sackville-street; and on his house being,
soon afterwards, shut up, they removed to Baxter's,
which afterwards became Thomas's, in Dover-street. In
January, 1792, they removed to Parsloe's, in St. James's-street;
and on February 26, 1799, to the Thatched
House, in the same street.</p>

<p>"So originated and was formed," says Mr. Forster,
"that famous Club, which had made itself a name in literary
history long before it received, at Garrick's funeral,
the name of the Literary Club, by which it is now known.
Its meetings were noised abroad; the fame of its conversations
received eager addition, from the difficulty of obtaining
admission to it; and it came to be as generally
understood that Literature had fixed her social head-quarters
here, as that Politics reigned supreme at Wildman's,
or the Cocoa-tree. With advantage, let me add,
to the dignity and worldly consideration of men of letters
themselves. 'I believe Mr. Fox will allow me to say,'
remarked the Bishop of St. Asaph, when the Society was
not more than fifteen years old, 'that the honour of being
elected into the Turk's Head Club, is not inferior to
that of being the representative of Westminster or Surrey.'
The Bishop had just been elected; but into such
lusty independence had the Club sprung up thus early,
that Bishops, even Lord Chancellors, were known to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
have knocked for admission unsuccessfully; and on the
night of St. Asaph's election, Lord Camden and the
Bishop of Chester were black-balled."</p>

<p>Of this Club, Hawkins was a most unpopular member:
even his old friend, Johnson, admitted him to be out of
place here. He had objected to Goldsmith, at the Club,
"as a mere literary drudge, equal to the task of compiling
and translating, but little capable of original, and
still less of poetical composition." Hawkins's "existence
was a kind of pompous, parsimonious, insignificant drawl,
cleverly ridiculed by one of the wits in an absurd epitaph:
'Here lies Sir John Hawkins, without his shoes
and stauckins.'" He was as mean as he was pompous
and conceited. He forbore to partake of the suppers at
the Club, and begged therefore to be excused from paying
his share of the reckoning. "And was he excused?"
asked Dr. Burney, of Johnson. "Oh yes, for no man is
angry at another for being inferior to himself. We all
scorned him, and admitted his plea. Yet I really believe
him to be an honest man at bottom, though, to be
sure, he is penurious and he is mean, and it must be
owned that he has a tendency to savageness." He did
not remain above two or three years in the Club, being
in a manner elbowed out in consequence of his rudeness
to Burke. Still, Burke's vehemence of will and sharp impetuosity
of temper constantly exposed him to prejudice
and dislike; and he may have painfully impressed others,
as well as Hawkins, at the Club, with a sense of his predominance.
This was the only theatre open to him.
"Here only," says Mr. Forster, "could he as yet pour
forth, to an audience worth exciting, the stores of argument
and eloquence he was thirsting to employ upon a
wider stage; the variety of knowledge, the fund of astonishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
imagery, the ease of philosophic illustration, the
overpowering copiousness of words, in which he has
never had a rival." Miss Hawkins was convinced that
her father was disgusted with the overpowering deportment
of Mr. Burke, and his monopoly of the conversation,
which made all the other members, excepting his
antagonist, Johnson, merely listeners. Something of the
same sort is said by that antagonist, though in a more
generous way. "What I most envy Burke for," said
Johnson, "is, that he is never what we call humdrum;
never unwilling to begin to talk, nor in haste to leave
off. Take up whatever topic you please, he is ready to
meet you. I cannot say he is good at listening. So
desirous is he to talk, that if one is speaking at this end
of the table, he'll speak to somebody at the other end."</p>

<p>The Club was an opportunity for both Johnson and
Burke; and for the most part their wit-combats seem not
only to have instructed the rest, but to have improved the
temper of the combatants, and to have made them more
generous to each other. "How very great Johnson has
been to-night!" said Burke to Bennet Langton, as they
left the Club together. Langton assented, but could have
wished to hear more from another person. "Oh no!"
replied Burke, "it is enough for me to have rung the
bell to him."</p>

<p>One evening he observed that a hogshead of claret,
which had been sent as a present to the Club, was almost
out; and proposed that Johnson should write for another,
in such ambiguity of expression as might have a chance
of procuring it also as a gift. One of the company
said, "Dr. Johnson shall be our dictator."&mdash;"Were I,"
said Johnson, "your dictator, you should have no wine:
it would be my business cavere ne quid detrimenti respublica
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
caperet:&mdash;wine is dangerous; Rome was ruined
by luxury." Burke replied: "If you allow no wine
as dictator, you shall not have me for master of the
horse."</p>

<p>Goldsmith, it must be owned, joined the Club somewhat
unwillingly, saying: "One must make some sacrifices
to obtain good society; for here I am shut out of
several places where I used to play the fool very agreeably."
His simplicity of character and hurried expression
often led him into absurdity, and he became in some
degree the butt of the company. The Club, notwithstanding
all its learned dignity in the eyes of the world,
could occasionally unbend and play the fool as well as
less important bodies. Some of its jocose conversations
have at times leaked out; and the Society in which Goldsmith
could venture to sing his song of "An Old Woman
tossed in a Blanket" could not be so very staid in its
gravity. Bennet Langton and Topham Beauclerk were,
doubtless, induced to join the Club through their devotion
to Johnson, and the intimacy of these two very
young and aristocratic young men with the stern and
somewhat melancholy moralist. Bennet Langton was
of an ancient family, who held their ancestral estate
of Langton in Lincolnshire, a great title to respect with
Johnson. "Langton, Sir," he would say, "has a grant
of free warren from Henry the Second; and Cardinal
Stephen Langton, in King John's reign, was of this
family."</p>

<p>Langton was of a mild, contemplative, enthusiastic
nature. When but eighteen years of age, he was so
delighted with reading Johnson's <i>Rambler</i>, that he came
to London chiefly with a view to obtain an introduction
to the author.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>Langton went to pursue his studies at Trinity College,
Oxford, where Johnson saw much of him during a visit
which he paid to the University. He found him in
close intimacy with Topham Beauclerk, a youth two
years older than himself, very gay and dissipated, and
wondered what sympathies could draw two young men
together of such opposite characters. On becoming acquainted
with Beauclerk, he found that, rake though he
was, he possessed an ardent love of literature, an acute
understanding, polished wit, innate gentility, and high
aristocratic breeding. He was, moreover, the only son
of Lord Sidney Beauclerk, and grandson of the Duke of
St. Albans, and was thought in some particulars to have
a resemblance to Charles the Second. These were high
recommendations with Johnson; and when the youth testified
a profound respect for him, and an ardent admiration
of his talents, the conquest was complete; so that
in a "short time," says Boswell, "the moral, pious Johnson
and the gay dissipated Beauclerk were companions."</p>

<p>When these two young men entered the Club, Langton
was about twenty-two, and Beauclerk about twenty-four
years of age, and both were launched on London life.
Langton, however, was still the mild, enthusiastic scholar,
steeped to the lips in Greek, with fine conversational
powers, and an invaluable talent for listening. He was
upwards of six feet high, and very spare. "Oh that
we could sketch him!" exclaims Miss Hawkins, in her
Memoirs, "with his mild countenance, his elegant features,
and his sweet smile, sitting with one leg twisted
round the other, as if fearing to occupy more space than
was equitable; his person inclining forward, as if wanting
strength to support his weight; and his arms crossed over
his bosom, or his hands locked together on his knee."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Beauclerk, on such occasions, sportively compared him
to a stork in Raphael's cartoons, standing on one leg.
Beauclerk was more a "man upon town," a lounger in
St. James's-street, an associate with George Selwyn, with
Walpole, and other aristocratic wits, a man of fashion at
court, a casual frequenter of the gaming-table; yet, with
all this, he alternated in the easiest and happiest manner
the scholar and the man of letters; lounged into the Club
with the most perfect self-possession, bringing with him
the careless grace and polished wit of high-bred society,
but making himself cordially at home among his
learned fellow-members.</p>

<p>Johnson was exceedingly chary at first of the exclusiveness
of the Club, and opposed to its being augmented in
number. Not long after its institution, Sir Joshua Reynolds
was speaking of it to Garrick. "I like it much,"
said little David, briskly, "I think I shall be of you."
"When Sir Joshua mentioned this to Dr. Johnson," says
Boswell, "he was much displeased with the actor's conceit.
'<i>He'll be of us!</i>' growled he; 'how does he know
we will <i>permit</i> him? The first duke in England has no
right to hold such language."</p>

<p>When Sir John Hawkins spoke favourably of Garrick's
pretensions, "Sir," replied Johnson, "he will disturb us
by his buffoonery." In the same spirit he declared to
Mr. Thrale, that if Garrick should apply for admission,
he would black-ball him. "Who, Sir?" exclaimed Thrale,
with surprise: "Mr. Garrick&mdash;your friend, your companion&mdash;black-ball
him?" "Why, Sir," replied Johnson,
"I love my little David dearly&mdash;better than all or
any of his flatterers do; but surely one ought to sit in
a society like ours,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Unelbowed by a gamester, pimp, or player."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>The exclusion from the Club was a sore mortification
to Garrick, though he bore it without complaining. He
could not help continually asking questions about it&mdash;what
was going on there?&mdash;whether he was ever the
subject of conversation? By degrees the rigour of the
Club relaxed; some of the members grew negligent.
Beauclerk lost his right of membership by neglecting to
attend. On his marriage, however, with Lady Diana
Spencer, daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, and
recently divorced from Viscount Bolingbroke, he had
claimed and regained his seat in the Club. The number
of the members had likewise been augmented. The
proposition to increase it originated with Goldsmith.
"It would give," he thought, "an agreeable variety to
their meetings; for there can be nothing new amongst
us," said he; "we have travelled over each other's
minds." Johnson was piqued at the suggestion. "Sir,"
said he, "you have not travelled over my mind, I promise
you." Sir Joshua, less confident in the exhaustless
fecundity of his mind, felt and acknowledged the
force of Goldsmith's suggestion. Several new members,
therefore, had been added; the first, to his great joy,
was David Garrick. Goldsmith, who was now on cordial
terms with him, had zealously promoted his election,
and Johnson had given it his warm approbation.
Another new member was Beauclerk's friend, Lord
Charlemont; and a still more important one was Mr.,
afterwards Sir William Jones, the linguist. George Colman,
the elder, was a lively Club-man. One evening
at the Club he met Boswell; they talked of Johnson's
<i>Journey to the Western Islands</i>, and of his coming away
"willing to believe the second sight," which seemed to
excite some ridicule. "I was then," says Boswell, "so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
impressed with the truth of many of the stories which I
had been told, that I avowed my conviction, saying, "He
is only <i>willing</i> to believe&mdash;I <i>do</i> believe; the evidence is
enough for me, though not for his great mind. What
will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle; I am
filled with belief."&mdash;"Are you?" said Colman; "then
cork it up.""</p>

<p>Five years after the death of Garrick, Dr. Johnson
dined with the Club <i>for the last time</i>. This is one of
the most melancholy entries by Boswell. "On Tuesday,
June 22 (1784), I dined with him (Johnson) at
the Literary Club, the last time of his being in that
respectable society. The other members present were
the Bishop of St. Asaph, Lord Eliot, Lord Palmerston
(father of the Premier), Dr. Fordyce, and Mr. Malone.
He looked ill; but he had such a manly fortitude, that
he did not trouble the company with melancholy complaints.
They all showed evident marks of kind concern
about him, with which he was much pleased, and he
exerted himself to be as entertaining as his indisposition
allowed him."</p>

<p>From the time of Garrick's death the Club was known
as "The Literary Club," since which it has certainly
lost its claim to this epithet. It was originally a club
of authors <i>by profession</i>; it now numbers very few except
titled members (the majority having some claims
to literary distinction), which was very far from the intention
of its founders. To this the author of the paper
in the <i>National Review</i> demurs. Writing in 1857, he
says: "Perhaps it now numbers on its list more titled
members and fewer authors by profession, than its founders
would have considered desirable. This opinion,
however, is quite open to challenge. Such men as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Marquis of Lansdowne, the late Lord Ellesmere, Lords
Brougham, Carlisle, Aberdeen, and Glenelg, hold their
place in 'the Literary Club' quite as much by virtue
of their contributions to literature, or their enlightened
support of it, as by their right of rank." [How many of
these noble members have since paid the debt of nature!]</p>

<p>"At all events," says Mr. Taylor, "the Club still
acknowledges literature as its foundation, and love of
literature as the tie which binds together its members,
whatever their rank and callings. Few Clubs can show
such a distinguished brotherhood of members as 'the
Literary.' Of authors proper, from 1764 to this date
(1857), may be enumerated, besides its original members,
Johnson and Goldsmith, Dyer and Percy, Gibbon
and Sir William Jones, Colman, the two Wartons,
Farmer, Steevens, Burney, and Malone, Frere and George
Ellis, Hallam, Milman, Mountstuart Elphinstone, and
Lord Stanhope.</p>

<p>"Among men equally conspicuous in letters and the
Senate, what names outshine those of Burke and Sheridan,
Canning, Brougham, and Macaulay? Of statesmen
and orators proper, the Club claims Fox, Windham,
Thomas Grenville, Lord Liverpool; Lords Lansdowne,
Aberdeen, and Clarendon. Natural science is
represented by Sir Joseph Banks, in the last century;
by Professor Owen in this. Social science can have no
nobler representative than Adam Smith; albeit, Boswell
did think the Club had lost caste by electing him.
Mr. N. W. Senior is the political economist of the present
Club. Whewell must stand alone as the embodiment
of omniscience, which before him was unrepresented.
Scholars and soldiers may be equally proud of
Rennel, Leake, and Mure. Besides the clergymen already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
enumerated as authors, the Church has contributed
a creditable list of bishops and inferior dignitaries:
Shipley of St. Asaph, Barnard of Killaloe, Marley
of Pomfret, Hinchcliffe of Peterborough, Douglas of
Salisbury, Blomfield of London, Wilberforce of Oxford,
Dean Vincent of Westminster, Archdeacon Burney; and
Dr. Hawtrey, late master and present provost of Eton.</p>

<p>"Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Charles Eastlake are
its two chief pillars of art, slightly unequal. With them
we may associate Sir William Chambers and Charles
Wilkins. The presence of Drs. Nugent, Blagden, Fordyce,
Warren, Vaughan, and Sir Henry Halford, is a
proof that in the Club medicine has from the first kept
up its kinship with literature.</p>

<p>"The profession of the law has given the Society Lord
Ashburton, Lord Stowell, and Sir William Grant, Charles
Austin, and Pemberton Leigh. Lord Overstone may
stand as the symbol of money; unless Sir George Cornewall
Lewis is to be admitted to that honour by virtue of
his Chancellorship of the Exchequer. Sir George would,
probably, prefer his claims to Club membership as a
scholar and political writer, to any that can be picked
out of a Budget.</p>

<p>"Take it all in all, the Literary Club has never degenerated
from the high standard of intellectual gifts
and personal qualities, which made those unpretending
suppers at the Turk's Head an honour eagerly contended
for by the wisest, wittiest, and noblest of the eighteenth
century."</p>

<p>Malone, in 1810, gave the total number of those who
had been members of the Club from its foundation, at
seventy-six, of whom fifty-five had been authors. Since
1810, however, literature has far less preponderance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>The designation of the Society has been again changed
to "the Johnson Club." Upon the taking down of the
Thatched House Tavern, the Club removed to the
Clarendon Hotel, in Bond-street, where was celebrated
its centenary, in September, 1864. There were present,
upon this memorable occasion,&mdash;in the chair, the Dean
of St. Paul's; his Excellency M. Van de Weyer, Earls
Clarendon and Stanhope; the Bishops of London and
Oxford; Lords Brougham, Stanley, Cranworth, Kingsdown,
and Harry Vane; the Right Hon. Sir Edmund
Head, Spencer Walpole, and Robert Lowe; Sir Henry
Holland, Sir C. Eastlake, Sir Roderick Murchison, Vice-Chancellor
Sir W. Page Wood, the Master of Trinity,
Professor Owen, Mr. G. Grote, Mr. C. Austen, Mr. H.
Reeve, and Mr. G. Richmond. Among the few members
prevented from attending were the Duke of Argyll
(in Scotland), the Earl of Carlisle (in Ireland), Earl
Russell, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Overstone
(at Oxford), Lord Glenelg (abroad), and Mr. W.
Stirling (from indisposition). Mr. N. W. Senior, who
was the political economist of the Club, died in June,
preceding, in his sixty-fourth year.</p>

<p>Hallam and Macaulay were among the constant attendants
at its dinners, which take place twice a month
during the Parliamentary season. The custody of the
books and archives of the Club rests with the secretary,
Dr. Milman, the venerable Dean of St. Paul's, who takes
great pride and pleasure in showing to literary friends
the valuable collection of autographs which these books
contain. Among the memorials is the portrait of Sir
Joshua Reynolds, with spectacles on, similar to the picture
in the Royal Collection: this portrait was painted
and presented by Sir Joshua, as the founder of the Club.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Macaulay has grouped, with his accustomed felicity
of language, this celebrated congress of men of
letters.</p>

<p>"To discuss questions of taste, of learning, of casuistry,
in language so exact and so forcible that it might have
been printed without the alteration of a word," was to
Johnson no exertion, but a pleasure. He loved, as he
said, to fold his legs and have his talk out. He was ready
to bestow the overflowings of his full mind on anybody
who would start a subject, on a fellow-passenger in a stage-coach,
or on the person who sat at the same table with
him in an eating-house. But his conversation was nowhere
so brilliant and striking as when he was surrounded
by a few friends, whose abilities and knowledge enabled
them, as he once expressed it, to send him back every ball
that he threw. Some of these, in 1764, formed themselves
into a Club, which gradually became a formidable power
in the commonwealth of letters. The verdicts pronounced
by this conclave on new books were speedily known over all
London, and were sufficient to sell off a whole edition in
a day, or to condemn the sheets to the service of the trunk-maker
and the pastrycook. Nor shall we think this
strange when we consider what great and various talents
and acquirements met in the little fraternity. Goldsmith
was the representative of poetry and light literature,
Reynolds of the Arts, Burke of political eloquence and
political philosophy. There, too, were Gibbon, the
greatest historian, and Jones, the greatest linguist of the
age. Garrick brought to the meetings his inexhaustible
pleasantry, his incomparable mimicry, and his consummate
knowledge of stage effect. Among the most constant
attendants were two high-born and high-bred gentlemen,
closely bound together by friendship, but of widely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
different characters and habits,&mdash;Bennet Langton, distinguished
by his skill in Greek literature, by the orthodoxy
of his opinions, and by the sanctity of his life; and Topham
Beauclerk, renowned for his amours, his knowledge
of the gay world, his fastidious taste, and his sarcastic wit.
To predominate over such a society was not easy. Yet
even over such a society Johnson predominated. Burke
might indeed have disputed the supremacy to which others
were under the necessity of submitting. But Burke,
though not generally a very patient listener, was content
to take the second part when Johnson was present; and
the Club itself, consisting of so many eminent men, is to
this day popularly designated as "Johnson's Club."</p>

<p>To the same master-hand we owe this cabinet picture.
"The [Literary Club] room is before us, and the table on
which stand the omelet for Nugent, and the lemons for
Johnson. There are assembled those heads which live for
ever on the canvas of Reynolds. There are the spectacles
of Burke, and the tall thin form of Langton; the courtly
sneer of Beauclerk, the beaming smile of Garrick, Gibbon
tapping his snuff-box, and Sir Joshua with his trumpet
in his ear. In the foreground is that strange figure
which is as familiar to us as the figures of those among
whom we have been brought up&mdash;the gigantic body, the
huge massy face, seamed with the scars of disease; the
brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the grey wig
with the scorched foretop; the dirty hands, the nails
bitten and pared to the quick. We see the eyes and the
nose moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy
form rolling; we hear it puffing; and then comes the
'Why, Sir?' and the 'What then, Sir?' and the 'No,
Sir!' and the 'You don't see your way through the
question, Sir!'"

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>GOLDSMITH'S CLUBS.</h2>

<p>However Goldsmith might court the learned circle of
the Literary Club, he was ill at ease there; and he had
social resorts in which he indemnified himself for this
restraint by indulging his humour without control. One
of these was a Shilling Whist Club, which met at the
Devil Tavern. The company delighted in practical jokes,
of which Goldsmith was often the butt. One night, he
came to the Club in a hackney-coach, when he gave the
driver a guinea instead of a shilling. He set this down
as a dead loss; but, on the next club-night, he was told
that a person at the street-door wanted to speak to him;
he went out, and to his surprise and delight, the coachman
had brought him back the guinea! To reward such
honesty, he collected a small sum from the Club, and
largely increased it from his own purse, and with this
reward sent away the coachman. He was still loud in
his praise, when one of the Club asked to see the returned
guinea. To Goldsmith's confusion it proved to be
a counterfeit: the laughter which succeeded, showed him
that the whole was a hoax, and the pretended coachman
as much a counterfeit as the guinea. He was so disconcerted
that he soon beat a retreat for the evening.</p>

<p>Another of these small Clubs met on Wednesday evenings,
at the Globe Tavern, in Fleet-street; where songs,
jokes, dramatic imitations, burlesque parodies, and broad
sallies of humour, were the entertainments. Here a huge
ton of a man, named Gordon, used to delight Goldsmith
with singing the jovial song of "Nottingham Ale," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
looking like a butt of it. Here too, a wealthy pig-butcher
aspired to be on the most sociable terms with
Oliver; and here was Tom King, the comedian, recently
risen to eminence by his performance of Lord Ogleby,
in the new comedy of <i>The Clandestine Marriage</i>. A
member of note was also one Hugh Kelly, who was a
kind of competitor of Goldsmith, but a low one; for
Johnson used to speak of him as a man who had written
more than he had read. Another noted frequenter of
the Globe and Devil taverns was one Glover, who, having
failed in the medical profession, took to the stage; but
having succeeded in restoring to life a malefactor who
had just been executed, he abandoned the stage, and resumed
his wig and cane; and came to London to dabble
in physic and literature. He used to amuse the company
at the Club by his story-telling and mimicry,
giving capital imitations of Garrick, Foote, Colman,
Sterne, and others. It was through Goldsmith that
Glover was admitted to the Wednesday Club; he was,
however, greatly shocked by the free-and-easy tone in
which Goldsmith was addressed by the pig-butcher;
"Come, Noll," he would say as he pledged him, "here's
my service to you, old boy."</p>

<p>The evening's amusement at the Wednesday Club was
not, however, limited; it had the variety of epigram,
and here was first heard the celebrated epitaph, (Goldsmith
had been reading Pope and Swift's Miscellanies,)
on Edward Purdon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Here lies poor Ned Purdon, from misery freed,</p>
<p class="i2">Who long was a bookseller's hack;</p>
<p>He had led such a damnable life in this world,</p>
<p class="i2">I don't think he'll wish to come back."</p>
</div>

<p>It was in April of the present year that Purdon closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
his luckless life by suddenly dropping down dead in
Smithfield; and as it was chiefly Goldsmith's pittance
that had saved him thus long from starvation, it was
well that the same friend should give him his solitary
chance of escape from oblivion. "Doctor Goldsmith
made this epitaph," says William Ballantyne, "in his
way from his chambers in the Temple to the Wednesday
evening Club at the Globe. <i>I think he will never come
back</i>, I believe he said; I was sitting by him, and he repeated
it more than once. <i>I think he will never come
back!</i> Ah! and not altogether as a jest, it may be, the
second and the third time. There was something in Purdon's
fate, from their first meeting in college to that incident
in Smithfield, which had no very violent contrast
to his own; and remembering what Glover had said of
his frequent sudden descents from mirth to melancholy,
some such faithful change of temper would here have
been natural enough. 'His disappointments at these
times,' Glover tells us, 'made him peevish and sullen,
and he has often left his party of convivial friends
abruptly in the evening, in order to go home and brood
over his misfortunes.' But a better medicine for his
grief than brooding over it, was a sudden start into the
country to forget it; and it was probably with a feeling
of this kind he had in the summer revisited Islington;
he laboured during the autumn in a room of Canonbury
Tower; and often, in the evening, presided at the Crown
tavern, in Islington Lower Road, where Goldsmith and
his fellow-lodgers had formed a kind of temporary club.
At the close of the year he returned to the Temple, and
was again pretty constant in his attendance at Gerard-street."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>

<h2>THE DILETTANTI SOCIETY.</h2>

<p>The origin of this Society, which has now existed some
130 years, is due to certain gentlemen, who had travelled
much in Italy, and were desirous of encouraging at home
a taste for those objects which had contributed so much
to their intellectual gratification abroad. Accordingly,
in the year 1734, they formed themselves into a Society,
under the name of Dilettanti, (literally, lovers of the
Fine Arts,) and agreed upon certain Regulations to keep
up the spirit of their scheme, which combined friendly
and social intercourse with a serious and ardent desire to
promote the Arts. In 1751, Mr. James Stuart, "Athenian
Stuart," and Mr. Nicholas Revett, were elected members.
The Society liberally assisted them in their excellent
work, <i>The Antiquities of Athens</i>. In fact it was, in great
measure, owing to this Society that after the death of the
above two eminent architects, the work was not entirely
relinquished; and a large number of the plates were engraved
from drawings in the possession of the Dilettanti.
Walpole, speaking in 1743, of the Society, in connexion
with an opera subscription, says, "The nominal qualification
[to be a member] is having been in Italy, and the
real one, being drunk; the two chiefs are Lord Middlesex
and Sir Francis Dashwood, who were seldom sober the
whole time they were in Italy." We need scarcely add,
that the qualifications for election are no longer what
Walpole described them to have been.</p>

<p>In 1764, the Society being possessed of a considerable
sum above what their services required, various schemes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
were proposed for applying part of this money; and it
was at length resolved "that a person or persons properly
qualified, should be sent, with sufficient appointments,
to certain parts of the East, to collect information relative
to the former state of those countries, and particularly
to procure exact descriptions of the ruins of such
monuments of antiquity as are yet to be seen in those
parts."</p>

<p>Three persons were elected for this undertaking, Mr.
Chandler, of Magdalen College, Oxford, editor of the
<i>Marmora Oxoniensia</i>, was appointed to execute the classical
part of the plan. Architecture was assigned to
Mr. Revett; and the choice of a proper person for
taking views and copying the bas-reliefs, fell upon Mr.
Pars, a young painter of promise. Each person was
strictly enjoined to keep a regular journal, and hold a
constant correspondence with the Society.</p>

<p>The party embarked on June 9, 1764, in the <i>Anglicana</i>,
bound for Constantinople, and were just at the Dardanelles
on the 25th of August. Having visited the Sigæan
Promontory, the ruins of Troas, with the islands of
Tenedos and Scio, they arrived at the Smyrna on the 11th
of September. From that city, as their head-quarters,
they made several excursions. On the 20th of August,
1765, they sailed from Smyrna, and arrived at Athens
on the 30th of the same month, having touched at
Sunium and Ægina on their way. They staid at Athens
till June 11, 1766, visiting Marathon, Eleusis, Salamis,
Megara, and other places in the neighbourhood. Leaving
Athens, they proceeded by the little island of Calauria
to Trezene, Epidaurus, Argos, and Corinth. From this
they visited Delphi, Patræ, Elis, and Zante, whence they
sailed on the 31st of August, and arrived in England on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the 2nd of November following, bringing with them an
immense number of drawings, etc., the result of which
was the publication, at the expense of the Society, of two
magnificent volumes of <i>Ionian Antiquities</i>. The results
of the expedition were also the two popular works,
Chandler's Travels in Asia Minor, 1775; and his <i>Travels
in Greece</i>, in the following year; also, the volume of
Greek Inscriptions, 1774, containing the Sigæan inscription,
the marble of which has been since brought to England
by Lord Elgin; and the celebrated documents containing
the reconstruction of the Temple of Minerva
Polias, which Professor Wilkins illustrated in his <i>Prolusiones
Architectonicæ</i>, 1837.</p>

<p>Walpole, in 1791, has this odd passage upon the <i>Ionian
Antiquities</i>: "They who are industrious and correct,
and wish to forget nothing, should go to Greece,
where there is nothing left to be seen, but that ugly
pigeon-house, the Temple of the Winds, that fly-cage,
Demosthenes's Lantern, and one or two fragments of a
portico, or a piece of a column crushed into a mud wall;
and with such a morsel, and many quotations, a true
classic antiquary can compose a whole folio, and call it
<i>Ionian Antiquities</i>."</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, how came the Society to associate
so freely pleasure with graver pursuits? To this
it may be replied, that when the Dilettanti first met they
avowed friendly and social intercourse the first object
they had in view, although they soon showed that they
would combine with it a serious plan for the promotion
of the Arts in this country. For these persons were not
scholars, nor even men of letters; they were some of
the wealthiest noblemen and most fashionable men of
the day, who would naturally sup with the Regent as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
went through Paris, and find themselves quite at home
in the Carnival of Venice. These, too, were times of
what would now be considered very licentious merriment
and very unscrupulous fun,&mdash;times when men of independent
means and high rank addicted themselves to
pleasure, and gave vent to their full animal spirits with
a frankness that would now be deemed not only vulgar
but indecorous, while they evinced an earnestness about
objects now thought frivolous which it is very easy to
represent as absurd. In assuming, however, the name
of "Dilettanti" they evidently attached to it no light
and superficial notion. The use of that word as one of
disparagement or ridicule is quite recent. The same
may be said of "Virtù," which, in the artistic sense,
does not seem to be strictly academical, but that of
"Virtuoso" is so, undoubtedly, and it means the "capable"
man,&mdash;the man who has a right to judge on
matters requiring a particular faculty: Dryden says:
"Virtuoso the Italians call a man 'who loves the noble
arts, and is a critic in them,' or, as old Glanville says,'
'who dwells in a higher region than other mortals.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when the Dilettanti mention 'the cause of
virtue' as a high object which they will never abandon,
they express their belief that the union into which they
had entered had a more important purpose than any
personal satisfaction could give it, and that they did engage
themselves thereby in some degree to promote the
advantage of their country and of mankind.</p>

<p>"Of all the merry meetings these gay gentlemen had
together, small records remain. We, looking back out
of a graver time, can only judge from the uninterrupted
course of their festive gatherings, from the names of the
statesmen, the wits, the scholars, the artists, the amateurs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
that fill the catalogue, from the strange mixture
of dignities and accessions to wealth for which, by the
rules of the Society, fines were paid,&mdash;and above all, by
the pictures which they possess,&mdash;how much of the pleasantry
and the hearty enjoyment must have been mixed
up with the more solid pursuits of the Members. Cast
your eye over the list of those who met together at the
table of the Dilettanti any time between 1770 and 1790."<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Here occur the names of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Earl
Fitzwilliam, Charles James Fox, Hon. Stephen Fox
(Lord Holland), Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick, Charles Howard
(Duke of Norfolk), Lord Robert Spencer, George
Selwyn, Colonel Fitzgerald, Hon. H. Conway, Joseph
Banks, Duke of Dorset, Sir William Hamilton, David
Garrick, George Colman, Joseph Windham, R. Payne
Knight, Sir George Beaumont, Towneley, and others of
less posthumous fame, but probably of not less agreeable
companionship.</p>

<p>The funds must have largely benefited by the payment
of fines, some of which were very strange. Those paid
"on increase of income, by inheritance, legacy, marriage,
or preferment," are very odd; as, five guineas by Lord
Grosvenor, on his marriage with Miss Leveson Gower;
eleven guineas by the Duke of Bedford, on being appointed
First Lord of the Admiralty; ten guineas compounded
for by Bubb Dodington, as Treasurer of the
Navy; two guineas by the Duke of Kingston for a Colonelcy
of Horse (then valued at 400<i>l.</i> per annum);
twenty-one pounds by Lord Sandwich on going out as
Ambassador to the Congress at Aix-la-Chapelle; and
twopence three-farthings by the same nobleman, on
becoming Recorder of Huntingdon; thirteen shillings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and fourpence by the Duke of Bedford, on getting the
Garter; and sixteen shillings and eightpence (Scotch)
by the Duke of Buccleuch, on getting the Thistle;
twenty-one pounds by the Earl of Holdernesse, as Secretary
of State; and nine pounds, nineteen shillings
and sixpence, by Charles James Fox, as a Lord of the
Admiralty.</p>

<p>In 1814, another expedition was undertaken by the
Society, when Sir William Gell, with Messrs. Gandy
and Bedford, professional architects, proceeded to the
Levant. Smyrna was again appointed the head-quarters
of the mission, and fifty pounds per month was assigned
to Gell, and two hundred pounds per annum to each of
the architects. An additional outlay was required; and
by this means the classical and antique literature of
England was enriched with the fullest and most accurate
descriptions of important remains of ancient art hitherto
given to the world.</p>

<p>The contributions of the Society to the æsthetic
studies of the time also deserve notice. The excellent
design to publish <i>Select Specimens of Antient Sculpture
preserved in the several Collections of Great Britain</i> was
carried into effect by Messrs. Payne Knight and Mr.
Towneley, 2 vols. folio, 1809-1835. Then followed Mr.
Penrose's <i>Investigations into the Principles of Athenian
Architecture</i>, printed in 1851.</p>

<p>About the year 1820, those admirable monuments of
Grecian art, called the Bronzes of Siris, were discovered
on the banks of that river, and were brought to this
country by the Chevalier Brondsted. The Dilettanti
Society immediately organized a subscription of 800<i>l.</i>,
and the Trustees of the British Museum completed the
purchase by the additional sum of 200<i>l.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>It was mainly through the influence and patronage of
the Dilettanti Society that the Royal Academy obtained
a Charter. In 1774, the interest of 4000<i>l.</i> three per
cents. was appropriated by the former for the purpose
of sending two students, recommended by the Royal
Academy, to study in Italy or Greece for three years.</p>

<p>In 1835 appeared a Second Volume on Ancient Sculpture.
The Society at this time included, among a list
of sixty-four names of the noble and learned, those of
Sir William Gell, Mr. Towneley, Richard Westmacott,
Henry Hallam, the Duke of Bedford, Sir M. A. Shee,
P.R.A., Henry T. Hope; and Lord Prudhoe, afterwards
Duke of Northumberland.</p>

<p>That a Society possessing so much wealth and social
importance as the Dilettanti should not have built for
themselves a mansion is surprising. In 1747 they obtained
a plot of ground in Cavendish Square, for this
purpose; but in 1760, they disposed of the property.
Between 1761 and 1764 the project of an edifice in Piccadilly,
on the model of the Temple of Pola, was agitated
by the Committee; two sites were proposed, one
between Devonshire and Bath Houses, the other on the
west side of Cambridge House. This scheme was also
abandoned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Society were accustomed to meet at
the Thatched House Tavern, the large room of which
was hung with portraits of the Dilettanti. Sir Joshua
Reynolds, who was a member, painted for the Society
three capital pictures:&mdash;1. A group in the manner of
Paul Veronese, containing the portraits of the Duke of
Leeds, Lord Dundas, Constantine Lord Mulgrave, Lord
Seaforth, the Hon. Charles Greville, Charles Crowle, Esq.,
and Sir Joseph Banks. 2. A group in the manner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the same master, containing portraits of Sir William
Hamilton, Sir Watkin W. Wynne, Richard Thomson,
Esq., Sir John Taylor, Payne Galway, Esq., John
Smythe, Esq., and Spencer S. Stanhope, Esq. 3. Head
of Sir Joshua, dressed in a loose robe, and in his own
hair. The earlier portraits are by Hudson, Reynolds's
master.</p>

<p>Some of these portraits are in the costume familiar to
us through Hogarth; others are in Turkish or Roman
dresses. There is a mixture of the convivial in all these
pictures: many are using wine-glasses of no small size:
Lord Sandwich, for instance, in a Turkish costume, casts
a most unorthodox glance upon a brimming goblet in
his left hand, while his right holds a flask of great capacity.
Sir Bouchier Wray is seated in the cabin of a
ship, mixing punch, and eagerly embracing the bowl, of
which a lurch of the sea would seem about to deprive
him: the inscription is <i>Dulce est desipere in loco</i>. Here
is a curious old portrait of the Earl of Holdernesse, in a
red cap, as a gondolier, with the Rialto and Venice in
the background; there is Charles Sackville, Duke of
Dorset, as a Roman senator, dated 1738; Lord Galloway,
in the dress of a cardinal; and a very singular likeness
of one of the earliest of the Dilettanti, Lord Le
Despencer, as a monk at his devotions: his Lordship is
clasping a brimming goblet for his rosary, and his eyes
are not very piously fixed on a statue of the Venus de'
Medici. It must be conceded that some of these pictures
remind one of the Medmenham orgies, with which
some of the Dilettanti were not unfamiliar. The ceiling
of the large room was painted to represent sky, and
crossed by gold cords interlacing each other, and from
their knots were hung three large glass chandeliers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>The Thatched House has disappeared, but the pictures
have been well cared for. The Dilettanti have removed
to another tavern, and dine together on the first Sunday
in every month, from February to July. The late Lord
Aberdeen, the Marquises of Northampton and Lansdowne,
and Colonel Leake, and Mr. Broderip, were
members; as was also the late Lord Northwick, whose
large collection of pictures at Thirlestane, Cheltenham,
was dispersed by sale in 1859.</p>

<h2>THE ROYAL NAVAL CLUB.</h2>

<p>About the year 1674, according to a document in the
possession of Mr. Fitch of Norwich, a Naval Club was
started "for the improvement of a mutuall Society, and
an encrease of Love and Kindness amongst them;" and
that consummate seaman, Admiral Sir John Kempthorne,
was declared Steward of the institution. This was the
precursor of the Royal Naval Club of 1765, which,
whether considered for its amenities or its extensive
charities, may be justly cited as a model establishment.
(<i>Admiral Smyth's Rise and Progress of the Royal Society
Club</i>, p. 9.) The members of this Club annually
distribute a considerable sum among the distressed
widows and orphans of those who have spent their
days in the naval service of their country. The Club
was accustomed to dine together at the Thatched
House Tavern, on the anniversary of the Battle of the
Nile.</p>

<p>"Founded on the model of the old tavern or convivial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Clubs, but confined exclusively to members of the
Naval Service, the Royal Naval Club numbered among
its members men from the days of Boscawen, Rodney,
and 'the first of June' downwards. It was a favourite
retreat for William IV. when Duke of Clarence; and his
comrade, Sir Philip Durham, the survivor of Nelson, and
almost the last of the 'old school,' frequented it. Sir
Philip, however, was by no means one of the Trunnion
class. Coarseness and profane language, on the contrary,
he especially avoided; but in 'spinning a yarn' there
has been none like him since the days of Smollett. The
loss of the Royal George, from which he was one of the
few, if, indeed, not only officer, who escaped, was a
favourite theme; and the Admiral, not content with
having made his escape, was wont to maintain that he
swam ashore with his midshipman's dirk in his teeth.
Yet Sir Philip would allow no one to trench on his
manor. One day, when a celebrated naval captain, with
the view of quizzing him, was relating the loss of a merchantman
on the coast of South America, laden with
Spitalfields products, and asserting that silk was so plentiful,
and the cargo so scattered, that the porpoises were
for some hours enmeshed in its folds: 'Ay, ay,' replied
Sir Philip, 'I believe you; for I was once cruising on
that coast myself, in search of a privateer, and having
lost our fore-topsail one morning in a gale of wind, we
next day found it tied round a whale's neck by way of a
cravat.' Sir Philip was considered to have the best of
it, and the novelist was mute."<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE WYNDHAM CLUB.</h2>

<p>This Club, which partakes of the character of Arthur's
and Boodle's, was founded by Lord Nugent, its object
being, as stated in Rule 1, "to secure a convenient and
agreeable place of meeting for a society of gentlemen,
all connected with each other by a common bond of
literary or personal acquaintance."</p>

<p>The Club, No. 11, St. James's-square, is named from
the mansion having been the residence of William Wyndham,
who has been described, and the description has
been generally adopted as appropriate, as a model of the
true English gentleman; and the fitness of the Club
designation is equally characteristic. He was an accomplished
scholar and mathematician. Dr. Johnson, writing
of a visit which Wyndham paid him, says: "Such conversation
I shall not have again till I come back to the
regions of literature, and there Wyndham is 'inter stellas
luna minores.'"</p>

<p>In the mansion also lived the accomplished John,
Duke of Roxburghe; and here the Roxburghe Library
was sold in 1812, the sale extending to forty-one days.
Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough lived here in 1814; and
subsequently, the Earl of Blessington, who possessed a
fine collection of pictures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE TRAVELLERS' CLUB.</h2>

<p>This famous Club was originated shortly after the Peace
of 1814, by the Marquis of Londonderry (then Lord
Castlereagh), with a view to a resort for gentlemen who
had resided or travelled abroad, as well as with a view
to the accommodation of foreigners, who, when properly
recommended, receive an invitation for the period of
their stay. One of the Rules directs "That no person
be considered eligible to the Travellers' Club who shall
not have travelled out of the British Islands to a distance
of at least 500 miles from London in a direct
line." Another Rule directs "That no dice and no
game of hazard be allowed in the rooms of the Club,
nor any higher stake than guinea points, and that no
cards be introduced before dinner."</p>

<p>Prince Talleyrand, during his residence in London,
generally joined the muster of whist-players at the
Travellers'; probably, here was the scene of this felicitous
rejoinder. The Prince was enjoying his rubber, when
the conversation turned on the recent union of an elderly
lady of respectable rank. "How ever could Madame
de S&mdash;&mdash; make such a match?&mdash;a person of her birth
to marry a <i>valet-de-chambre</i>!" "Ah," replied Talleyrand,
"it was late in the game: at nine we don't reckon
honours."</p>

<p>The present Travellers' Club-house, which adjoins the
Athenæum in Pall-Mall, was designed by Barry, R.A.,
and built in 1832. It is one of the architect's most
admired works. Yet, we have seen it thus treated, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
more smartness than judgment, by a critic who is annoyed
at its disadvantageous comparison with its more
gigantic neighbours:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Travellers' is worse, and looks very like a
sandwich at the Swindon station&mdash;a small stumpy piece
of beef between two huge pieces of bread, <i>i.e.</i> the Athenæum
and the Reform Clubs, which look as if they
were urging their migratory neighbour to resume the
peregrinations for which its members are remarkable.
Yet people have their names down ten years at the
Travellers' previous to their coming up for ballot. An
election reasonably extended would supply funds for a
more advantageous and extended position."</p>

<p>The architecture is the nobler Italian, resembling a
Roman palace: the plan is a quadrangle, with an open
area in the middle, so that all the rooms are well lighted.
The Pall-Mall front has a bold and rich cornice, and the
windows are decorated with Corinthian pilasters: the
garden front varies in the windows, but the Italian taste
is preserved throughout, with the most careful finish:
the roof is Italian tiles. To be more minute, the consent
of all competent judges has assigned a very high rank
to this building as a piece of architectural design; for if,
in point of mere <i>quantity</i>, it fall greatly short of many
contemporary structures, it surpasses nearly every one
of them in <i>quality</i>, and in the artist-like treatment. In
fact, it makes an epoch in our metropolitan architecture;
for before, we had hardly a specimen of that nobler
Italian style, which, instead of the flutter and flippery,
and the littleness of manner, which pervade most of the
productions of the Palladian school, is characterized by
breath and that refined simplicity arising from unity of
idea and execution, and from every part being consistently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
worked up, yet kept subservient to one predominating
effect. Unfortunately, the south front, which
is by far the more striking and graceful composition,
is comparatively little seen, being that facing Carlton
Gardens, and not to be approached so as to be studied
as it deserves; but when examined, it certainly must be
allowed to merit all the admiration it has obtained.
Though perfect, quiet, and sober in effect, and unostentatious
in character, this building of Barry's is remarkable
for the careful finish bestowed on every part
of it. It is this quality, together with the taste displayed
in the design generally, that renders it an architectural
bijou. Almost any one must be sensible of this, if he
will but be at the pains to compare it with the United
Service Club, eastward of which, as far as mere quantity
goes, there is much more.</p>

<p>Another critic remarks: "The Travellers' fairly makes
an epoch in the architectural history of Club-houses, as
being almost the first, if not the very first, attempt, to
introduce into this country that species of rich <i>astylar</i>
composition which has obtained the name of the Italian
palazzo mode, by way of contradistinction from Palladianism
and its orders. This production of Barry's has
given a fresh impulse to architectural design, and one in
a more artistic direction; and the style adopted by the
architect has been applied to various other buildings
in the provinces as well as in the metropolis; and its
influence has manifested itself in the taste of our recent
street architecture."</p>

<p>The Travellers' narrowly escaped destruction on October
24, 1850, when a fire did great damage to the
billiard-rooms, which were, by the way, an afterthought,
and addition to the original building, but by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
an improvement upon the first design, for they greatly
impaired the beauty of the garden-front.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE UNITED SERVICE CLUB.</h2>

<p>One of the oldest of the modern Clubs, was instituted
the year after the Peace of 1815, when a few officers of
influence in both branches of the Service had built for
them, by Sir R. Smirke, a Club-house at the corner of
Charles-street and Regent-street,&mdash;a frigid design, somewhat
relieved by sculpture on the entrance-front, of
Britannia distributing laurels to her brave sons by land
and sea. Thence the Club removed to a more spacious
house, in Waterloo-place, facing the Athenæum; the
Club-house in Charles-street being entered on by the
Junior United Service Club; but Smirke's cold design
has been displaced by an edifice of much more ornate
exterior and luxurious internal appliances.</p>

<p>The United Service Club (Senior) was designed by
Nash, and has a well-planned interior, exhibiting the
architect's well-known excellence in this branch of his
profession. The principal front facing Pall Mall has a
Roman-Doric portico; and above it a Corinthian portico,
with pediment. One of the patriarchal members
of the Club was Lord Lynedoch, the hero of the Peninsular
War, who lived under five sovereigns: he died in
his 93rd year, leaving behind him a name to be held
in honoured remembrance, while loyalty is considered
to be a real virtue, or military renown a passport to
fame. It is a curious fact that the Duke of Wellington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
fought his last battle at an earlier period of life than
that in which Lord Lynedoch "fleshed his maiden
sword;" and though we were accustomed to regard the
Duke himself as preserving his vigour to a surprisingly
advanced age, Lord Lynedoch was at his death old
enough to have been the father of his Grace. The
United Service was the favourite Club of the Duke, who
might often be seen dining here on a joint; and on
one occasion, when he was charged 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> instead of
1<i>s.</i> for it, he bestirred himself till the threepence was
struck off. The motive was obvious: he took the trouble
of objecting, so that he might sanction the principle.</p>

<p>Among the Club pictures is Jones's large painting of
the Battle of Waterloo; and the portrait of the Duke
of Wellington, painted for the Club by W. Robinson.
Here also are Stanfield's fine picture of the Battle of
Trafalgar; and a copy, by Lane, painted in 1851, of a
contemporary portrait of Sir Francis Drake, our "Elizabethan
Sea-King." The Club-house has of late years
been considerably enlarged.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE ALFRED CLUB.</h2>

<p>In the comparatively quiet Albemarle-street was instituted,
in 1808, the Alfred Club, which has, <i>ab initio</i>,
been remarkable for the number of travellers and men
of letters, who form a considerable proportion of its members.
Science is handsomely housed at the Royal Institution,
on the east side of the street; and literature
nobly represented by the large publishing-house of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Murray, on the west; both circumstances tributary to
the <i>otium</i> enjoyed in a Club. Yet, strangely enough, its
position has been a frequent source of banter to the
Alfred. First it was known by its cockney appellation
of <i>Half-read</i>. Lord Byron was a member, and he tells
us that "it was pleasant, a little too sober and literary,
and bored with Sotheby and Francis D'Ivernois; but
one met Rich, and Ward, and Valentia, and many other
pleasant or known people; and it was, in the whole, a
decent resource in a rainy day, in a dearth of parties, or
Parliament, or in an empty season."</p>

<p>Lord Dudley, writing to the Bishop of Llandaff, says:
"I am glad you mean to come into the Alfred this time.
We are the most abused, and most envied, and most
canvassed, Society that I know of, and we deserve neither
the one nor the other distinction. The Club is not so
good a resource as many respectable persons would believe,
nor are we by any means such quizzes or such
bores as the wags pretend. A duller place than the
Alfred there does not exist. I should not choose to be
quoted for saying so, but the bores prevail there to the
exclusion of every other interest. You hear nothing but
idle reports and twaddling opinions. They read the
<i>Morning Post</i> and the <i>British Critic</i>. It is the asylum
of doting Tories and drivelling quidnuncs. But they
are civil and quiet. You belong to a much better Club
already. The eagerness to get into it is prodigious."</p>

<p>Then, we have the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, with confirmation
strong of the two Lords:&mdash;"The Alfred received its
<i>coup-de-grâce</i> from a well-known story, (rather an indication
than a cause of its decline,) to the effect that Mr.
Canning, whilst in the zenith of his fame, dropped in accidentally
at a house dinner of twelve or fourteen, stayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
out the evening, and made himself remarkably agreeable,
without any one of the party suspecting who he was."</p>

<p>The dignified clergy, who, with the higher class of
lawyers, have long ago emigrated to the Athenæum and
University Clubs, formerly mustered in such great force
at the Alfred, that Lord Alvanley, on being asked in the
bow-window at White's, whether he was still a member,
somewhat irreverently replied: "Not exactly: I stood
it as long as I could, but when the seventeenth bishop
was proposed I gave in. I really could not enter the place
without being put in mind of my catechism." "Sober-minded
people," says the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, "may be
apt to think this formed the best possible reason for his
lordship's remaining where he was. It is hardly necessary
to say that the presence of the bishops and judges is
universally regarded as an unerring test of the high character
of a Club."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE ORIENTAL CLUB.</h2>

<p>Several years ago, the high dignitaries of the Church
and Law kept the Alfred to themselves; but this would
not do: then they admitted a large number of very respectable
good young men, who were unexceptionable,
but not very amusing. This, again, would not do. So,
now the Alfred joined, 1855, the Oriental, in Hanover-square.
And curiously enough, the latter Club has been
quizzed equally with the Alfred. In the merry days of
the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> of some thirty years since, we
read:&mdash;"The Oriental&mdash;or, as the hackney-coachmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
call it, the Horizontal Club&mdash;in Hanover-square, outdoes
even Arthur's for quietude. Placed at the corner of a
<i>cul-de-sac</i>&mdash;at least as far as carriages are concerned,
and in a part of the Square to which nobody not proceeding
to one of four houses which occupy that particular
side ever thinks of going, its little windows, looking
upon nothing, give the idea of mingled dulness and inconvenience.
From the outside it looks like a prison;&mdash;enter
it, it looks like an hospital, in which a smell of
curry-powder pervades the 'wards,'&mdash;wards filled with
venerable patients, dressed in nankeen shorts, yellow
stockings, and gaiters, and faces to match. <i>There</i> may
still be seen pigtails in all their pristine perfection. It
is the region of calico shirts, returned writers, and guinea-pigs
grown into bores. Such is the <i>nabobery</i>, into which
Harley-street, Wimpole-street, and Glocester-place, daily
empty their precious stores of bilious humanity." Time
has blunted the point of this satiric picture, the individualities
of which had passed away, even before the
amalgamation of the Oriental with the Alfred.</p>

<p>The Oriental Club was established in 1824, by Sir
John Malcolm, the traveller and brave soldier. The
members were noblemen and gentlemen associated with
the administration of our Eastern empire, or who have
travelled or resided in Asia, at St. Helena, in Egypt, at
the Cape of Good Hope, the Mauritius, or at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The Oriental was erected in 1827-8, by B. and P.
Wyatt, and has the usual Club characteristic of only one
tier of windows above the ground-floor; the interior has
since been redecorated and embellished by Collman.

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE ATHENÆUM CLUB.</h2>

<p>The Athenæum presents a good illustration of the
present Club system, of which it was one of the earliest
instances. By reference to the accounts of the Clubs
existing about the commencement of the present century,
it will be seen how greatly they differed, both in constitution
and purpose, from the modern large subscription-houses,
called Clubs; and which are to be compared with
their predecessors only in so far as every member must
be balloted for, or be chosen by the consent of the rest.
Prior to 1824, there was only one institution in the metropolis
particularly devoted to the association of Authors,
Literary Men, Members of Parliament, and promoters
generally of the Fine Arts. All other establishments
were more or less exclusive, comprising gentlemen
who screened themselves in the windows of White's,
or Members for Counties who darkened the doors of
Brookes's; or they were dedicated to the Guards, or
"men of wit and pleasure about town." It is true that
the Royal Society had its convivial meetings, as we have
already narrated; and small Clubs of members of other
learned Societies, were held; but with these exceptions,
there were no Clubs where individuals known for their
scientific or literary attainments, artists of eminence in
any class of the Fine Arts, and noblemen and gentlemen
distinguished as patrons of science, literature, and the arts,
could unite in friendly and encouraging intercourse; and
professional men were compelled either to meet at taverns,
or to be confined exclusively to the Society of their particular
professions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>To remedy this, on the 17th of February, 1824, a
preliminary meeting,&mdash;comprising Sir Humphry Davy,
the Right Hon. John Wilson Croker, Sir Francis Chantrey,
Richard Heber, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Dr. Thomas
Young, Lord Dover, Davie Gilbert, the Earl of Aberdeen,
Sir Henry Halford, Sir Walter Scott, Joseph Jekyll,
Thomas Moore, and Charles Hatchett,&mdash;was held in the
apartments of the Royal Society, at Somerset House; at
this meeting Professor Faraday assisted as secretary,
and it was agreed to institute a Club to be called "The
Society," subsequently altered to "The Athenæum."
"The Society" first met in the Clarence Club-house;
but, in 1830, the present mansion, designed by Decimus
Burton, was opened to the members.</p>

<p>The Athenæum Club-house is built upon a portion of
the court-yard of Carlton House. The architecture is
Grecian, with a frieze exactly copied from the Panathenaic
procession in the frieze of the Parthenon,&mdash;the
flower and beauty of Athenian youth, gracefully seated
on the most exquisitely sculptured horses, which Flaxman
regarded as the most precious example of Grecian
power in the sculpture of animals. Over the Roman
Doric entrance-portico is a colossal figure of Minerva,
by Baily, R.A.; and the interior has some fine casts of
<i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of sculpture. Here the architecture is
grand, massive, and severe. The noble Hall, 35 feet
broad by 57 feet long, is divided by scagliola columns and
pilasters, the capitals copied from the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates. This is the Exchange, or Lounge,
where the members meet. The floor is the Marmorato
Veneziano mosaic. Over each of the two fire-places, in
a niche, is a statue&mdash;the Diana Robing and the Venus
Victrix, selected by Sir Thomas Lawrence&mdash;a very fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
contrivance for sculptural display. The Library is the
best Club Library in London: it comprises the most rare
and valuable works, and a very considerable sum is annually
expended upon the collection, under the guidance
of members most eminent in literature and science.
Above the mantelpiece is a portrait of George IV., painted
by Lawrence, upon which he was engaged but a few
hours previous to his decease; the last bit of colour this
celebrated artist ever put upon canvas being that of
the hilt and sword-knot of the girdle; thus it remains
unfinished. The bookcases of the drawing-rooms are
crowned with busts of British worthies. Among the
Club gossip it is told that a member who held the
Library faith of the promise of the Fathers, and was anxious
to consult their good works, one day asked, in a
somewhat familiar tone of acquaintance with these respectable
theologians, "Is Justin Martyr here?"&mdash;"I do
not know," was the reply; "I will refer to the list, but
I do not think that gentleman is one of our members."</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, in his very pleasant work, <i>The Original</i>,
was one of the first to show how by the then new system
of Clubs the facilities of living were wonderfully increased,
whilst the expense was greatly diminished. For
a few pounds a year, advantages are to be enjoyed which
no fortunes, except the most ample, can procure. The
only Club (he continues) I belong to is the Athenæum,
which consists of twelve hundred members, amongst
whom are to be reckoned a large proportion of the most
eminent persons in the land, in every line,&mdash;civil, military,
and ecclesiastical,&mdash;peers spiritual and temporal
(ninety-five noblemen and twelve bishops), commoners,
men of the learned professions, those connected with
science, the arts, and commerce, in all its principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
branches, as well as the distinguished who do not belong
to any particular class. Many of these are to be met
with every day, living with the same freedom as in their
own houses, for 25 guineas entrance, and 6 guineas a
year. Every member has the command of an excellent
library, with maps; of newspapers, English and foreign;
the principal periodicals; writing materials, and attendance.
The building is a sort of palace, and is kept with
the same exactness and comfort as a private dwelling.
Every member is master, without any of the trouble of a
master: he can come when he pleases, and stay away
when he pleases, without anything going wrong; he has
the command of regular servants, without having to pay
or manage them; he can have whatever meal or refreshment
he wants, at all hours, and served up as in his own
house. He orders just what he pleases, having no interest
to think of but his own. In short, it is impossible to
suppose a greater degree of liberty in living.</p>

<p>"Clubs, as far as my observation goes, are favourable
to economy of time. There is a fixed place to go to,
everything is served with comparative expedition, and it
is not customary in general to remain long at table.
They are favourable to temperance. It seems that when
people can freely please themselves, and when they have
an opportunity of living simply, excess is seldom committed.
From an account I have of the expenses at the
Athenæum in the year 1832, it appears that 17,323
dinners cost, on an average, 2<i>s.</i> 9¾<i>d.</i> each, and that the
average quantity of wine for each person was a small
fraction more than half-a-pint.</p>

<p>"The expense of building the Club-house was 35,000<i>l.</i>,
and 5,000<i>l.</i> for furnishing; the plate, linen, and glass cost
2,500<i>l.</i>; library, 4,000<i>l.</i>, and the stock of wine in cellar is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
usually worth about 4000<i>l.</i>: yearly revenue about 9000<i>l.</i>"</p>

<p>The economical management of the Club has not,
however, been effected without a few sallies of humour.
In 1834, we read: "The mixture of Whigs, Radicals,
<i>savants</i>, foreigners, dandies, authors, soldiers, sailors,
lawyers, artists, doctors, and Members of both Houses
of Parliament, together with an exceedingly good average
supply of bishops, render the <i>mélange</i> very agreeable,
despite of some two or three bores, who 'continually do
dine;' and who, not satisfied with getting a 6<i>s.</i> dinner
for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 'continually do complain.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers, the poet, was one of the earliest members
of the Athenæum, and innumerable are the good
things, though often barbed with bitterness, which are
recorded of him.</p>

<p>Some years ago, judges, bishops, and peers used to
congregate at the Athenæum; but a club of twelve hundred
members cannot be select. "Warned by the necessity
of keeping up their number and their funds,
they foolishly set abroad a report that the finest thing
in the world was to belong to the Athenæum; and that
an opportunity offered for hobnobbing with archbishops,
and hearing Theodore Hook's jokes. Consequently all
the little crawlers and parasites, and gentility-hunters,
from all corners of London, set out upon the creep; and
they crept in at the windows and they crept down the area
steps, and they crept in unseen at the doors, and they
crept in under bishops' sleeves, and they crept in in
peers' pockets, and they were blown in by the winds of
chance. The consequence has been, that ninety-nine
hundredths of this Club are people who rather seek to
obtain a sort of standing by belonging to the Athenæum,
than to give it lustre by the talent of its members.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Nine-tenths of the intellectual writers of the age
would be certainly black-balled by the dunces. Notwithstanding
all this, and partly on account of this, the
Athenæum is a capital Club: the library is certainly the
best Club library in London, and is a great advantage
to a man who writes."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Theodore Hook was one of the most clubbable men of
his time. After a late breakfast, he would force and
strain himself at large arrears of literary toil, and then
drive rapidly from Fulham to town, and pay a visit
"first to one Club, where, the centre of an admiring
circle, his intellectual faculties were again upon the
stretch, and again aroused and sustained by artificial
means: the same thing repeated at a second&mdash;the same
drain and the same supply&mdash;ballot or general meeting
at a third, the chair taken by Mr. Hook, who addresses
the members, produces the accounts, audits and passes
them&mdash;gives a succinct statement of the prospects and
finances of the Society&mdash;parries an awkward question&mdash;extinguishes
a grumbler&mdash;confounds an opponent&mdash;proposes
a vote of thanks to himself, seconds, carries it,&mdash;and
returns thanks, with a vivacious rapidity that entirely
confounds the unorganized schemes of the minority&mdash;then
a chop in the committee-room, and just one
tumbler of brandy-and-water, or <i>two</i>, and we fear the
catalogue would not always close there."</p>

<p>At the Athenæum, Hook was a great card; and in
a note to the sketch of him in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
it is stated that the number of dinners at this Club
fell off by upwards of three hundred per annum after
Hook disappeared from his favourite corner, near the
door of the coffee-room. That is to say, there must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
have been some dozens of gentlemen who chose to dine
there once or twice every week of the season, merely for
the chance of Hook's being there, and permitting them
to draw their chairs to his little table in the course of
the evening. Of the extent to which he suffered from
this sort of invasion, there are several bitter oblique
complaints in his novels. The <i>corner</i> alluded to will,
we suppose, long retain the name which it derived from
him&mdash;<i>Temperance Corner</i>. Many grave and dignified
personages being frequent guests, it would hardly have
been seemly to be calling for repeated supplies of a certain
description; but the waiters well understood what
the oracle of the corner meant by "Another glass of
toast and water," or, "A little more lemonade."</p>

<h2>THE UNIVERSITY CLUB.</h2>

<p>In Suffolk-street, Pall Mall East, was instituted in 1824,
and the Club-house, designed by Deering and Wilkins,
architects, was opened in 1826. It is of the Grecian Doric
and Ionic orders; and the staircase walls have casts from
the Parthenon frieze. The Club consists chiefly of
Members of Parliament who have received University
education; several of the judges, and a large number of
beneficed clergymen. This Club has the reputation of
possessing the best stocked wine-cellar in London, which
is of no small importance to Members, clerical or lay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>ECONOMY OF CLUBS.</h2>

<p>Thirty years ago, Mr. Walker took some pains to disabuse
the public mind of a false notion that female
society was much affected by the multiplication of Clubs.
He remarks that in those hours of the evening, which are
peculiarly dedicated to society, he could scarcely count
twenty members in the suite of rooms upstairs at the
Athenæum Club. If female society be neglected, he
contended that it was not owing to the institution of
Clubs, but more probably to the long sittings of the
House of Commons, and to the want of easy access to
family circles. At the Athenæum he never heard it even
hinted, that married men frequented it to the prejudice
of their domestic habits, or that bachelors were kept
from general society. Indeed, Mr. Walker maintains,
that Clubs are a preparation and not a substitute for domestic
life. Compared with the previous system of living,
they induce habits of economy, temperance, refinement,
regularity, and good order. Still, a Club only offers an
imitation of the comforts of home, but only an imitation,
and one which will never supersede the reality.</p>

<p>However, the question became a subject for pleasant
satire. Mrs. Gore, in one of her clever novels, has these
shrewd remarks:&mdash;"London Clubs, after all, are not
bad things for family men. They act as conductors to
the storms usually hovering in the air. The man forced
to remain at home and vent his crossness on his wife
and children, is a much worse animal to bear with, than
the man who grumbles his way to Pall Mall, and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
daring to swear at the Club-servants, or knock about the
club-furniture, becomes socialized into decency. Nothing
like the subordination exercised in a community of equals
for reducing a fiery temper."</p>

<p>Mr. Hood, in his <i>Comic Annual</i> for 1838, took up
the topic in his rich vein of comic humour, and here is
the amusing result:&mdash;</p>

<p>The satire soon reached the stage. About five-and-twenty
years since there was produced at the old wooden
Olympic Theatre, Mr. Mark Lemon's farce, <i>The Ladies'
Club</i>, which proved one of the most striking pieces of the
time. "Though in 1840 Clubs, in the modern sense of
the word, had been for some years established, they were
not quite recognized as social necessities, and the complaints
of married ladies and of dowagers with marriageable
daughters, to the effect that these institutions caused
husbands to desert the domestic hearth and encouraged
bachelors to remain single, expressed something of a
general feeling. Public opinion was ostentatiously on
the side of the ladies and against the Clubs, and to this
opinion Mr. Mark Lemon responded when he wrote his
most successful farce."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Here are a few experiences of Club-life. "There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
many British lions in the coffee-room who have dined
off a joint and beer, and have drunk a pint of port-wine
afterwards, and whose bill is but 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> One great
luxury in a modern Club is that there is no temptation
to ostentatious expense. At an hotel there is an inclination
in some natures to be 'a good customer.' At
a Club the best men are generally the most frugal&mdash;they
are afraid of being thought like that little snob, Calicot,
who is always surrounded by fine dishes and expensive
wines (even when alone), and is always in loud talk with
the butler, and in correspondence with the committee
about the cook. Calicot is a rich man, with a large
bottle-nose, and people black-ball his friends.</p>

<p>"For a home, a man must have a large Club, where the
members are recruited from a large class, where the
funds are in a good state, where a large number every
day breakfast and dine, and where a goodly number
think it necessary to be on the books and pay their subscriptions,
although they do not use the Club. Above
all, your home Club should be a large Club, because, even
if a Club be ever so select, the highest birth and most
unexceptionable fashion do not prevent a man from
being a <i>bore</i>. Every Club must have its bores; but in a
large Club <i>you can get out of their way</i>."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>"It is a vulgar error to regard a Club as the rich man's
public-house: it bears no analogy to a public-house: it is
as much the private property of its members as any
ordinary dwelling-house is the property of the man who
built it.</p>

<p>"Our Clubs are thoroughly characteristic of us. We
are a <i>proud</i> people,&mdash;it is of no use denying it,&mdash;and have
a horror of indiscriminate association; hence the exclusiveness
of our Clubs.</p>

<p>"We are an <i>economical</i> people, and love to obtain the
greatest possible amount of luxury at the least possible
expense: hence, at our Clubs we dine at prime cost, and
drink the finest wines at a price which we should have
to pay for slow poison at a third-rate inn.</p>

<p>"We are a <i>domestic</i> people, and hence our Clubs afford
us all the comforts of home, when we are away from
home, or when we have none. Finally, we are a <i>quarrelsome</i>
people, and the Clubs are eminently adapted for the
indulgence of that amiable taste. A book is kept constantly
open to receive the outpourings of our ill-humour
against all persons and things. The smokers quarrel
with the non-smokers: the billiard-players wage war
against those who don't play; and, in fact, an internecine
war is constantly going on upon every conceivable
trifle; and when we retire exhausted from the fray, sofas
and <i>chaises longues</i> are everywhere at hand, whereon to
repose <i>in extenso</i>. The London Clubs are certainly the
abodes of earthly bliss, yet the ladies won't think so."<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h2>THE UNION CLUB.</h2>

<p>This noble Club-house, at the south-west angle of
Trafalgar-square, was erected in 1824, from designs by
Sir Robert Smirke, R.A. It is much less ornate than
the Club-houses of later date; but its apartments are
spacious and handsome, and it faces one of the finest
open spaces in the metropolis. As its name implies, it
consists of politicians, and professional and mercantile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
men, without reference to party opinions; and, it has
been added, is "a resort of wealthy citizens, who just
fetch Charing Cross to inhale the fresh air as it is drawn
from the Park through the funnel, by Berkeley House,
out of Spring Gardens, into their bay-window."</p>

<p>James Smith, one of the authors of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>,
was a member of the Union, which he describes
as chiefly composed of merchants, lawyers, members of
Parliament, and of "gentlemen at large." He thus
sketches a day's life here. "At three o'clock I walk to
the Union Club, read the journals, hear Lord John
Russell deified or diablerized, do the same with Sir Robert
Peel or the Duke of Wellington, and then join a
knot of conversationists by the fire till six o'clock. We
then and there discuss the Three per Cent. Consols
(some of us preferring Dutch Two-and-a-half per Cents.),
and speculate upon the probable rise, shape, and cost of
the New Exchange. If Lady Harrington happen to
drive past our window in her landau, we compare her
equipage to the Algerine Ambassador's; and when politics
happen to be discussed, rally Whigs, Radicals, and
Conservatives alternately, but never seriously, such subjects
having a tendency to create acrimony. At six,
the room begins to be deserted; wherefore I adjourn to
the dining-room, and gravely looking over the bill of
fare, exclaim to the waiter, 'Haunch of mutton and
apple-tart!' These viands dispatched, with the accompanying
liquids and water, I mount upward to the library,
take a book and my seat in the arm-chair, and
read till nine. Then call for a cup of coffee and a biscuit,
resuming my book till eleven; afterwards return
home to bed." The smoking-room is a very fine apartment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>One of the grumbling members of the Union was Sir
James Aylott, a two-bottle man; one day, observing
Mr. James Smith furnished with half-a-pint of sherry,
Sir James eyed his cruet with contempt, and exclaimed:
"So, I see you have got one of those <span class="nobreak">d&mdash;d</span> life-preservers."</p>

<p>The Club has ever been famed for its <i>cuisine</i>, upon
the strength of which, we are told that next-door to the
Club-house, in Cockspur-street, was established the
Union Hotel, which speedily became renowned for its
turtle; it was opened in 1823, and was one of the best
appointed hotels of its day; and Lord Panmure, a
<i>gourmet</i> of the highest order, is said to have taken up
his quarters in this hotel, for several successive seasons,
for the sake of the soup.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<h2>THE GARRICK CLUB.</h2>

<p>Mr. Thackeray was a hearty lover of London, and has
left us many evidences of his sincerity. He greatly
favoured Covent Garden, of which he has painted this
clever picture, sketched from "the Garden," where are
annually paid for fruits and vegetables some three
millions sterling:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The two great national theatres on one side, a
churchyard full of mouldy but undying celebrities on
the other; a fringe of houses studded in every part with
anecdote and history; an arcade, often more gloomy
and deserted than a cathedral aisle; a rich cluster of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
brown old taverns&mdash;one of them filled with the counterfeit
presentment of many actors long since silent, who
scowl or smile once more from the canvas upon the
grandsons of their dead admirers; a something in the
air which breathes of old books, old pictures, old
painters, and old authors; a place beyond all other
places one would choose in which to hear the chimes at
midnight; a crystal palace&mdash;the representative of the
present&mdash;which peeps in timidly from a corner upon
many things of the past; a withered bank, that has
been sucked dry by a felonious clerk; a squat building,
with a hundred columns and chapel-looking fronts,
which always stands knee-deep in baskets, flowers, and
scattered vegetables; a common centre into which
Nature showers her choicest gifts, and where the kindly
fruits of the earth often nearly choke the narrow
thoroughfares; a population that never seems to sleep,
and that does all in its power to prevent others sleeping;
a place where the very latest suppers and the
earliest breakfasts jostle each other on the footways&mdash;such
is Covent-Garden Market, with some of its surrounding
features."</p>

<p>About a century and a quarter ago, the parish of St.
Paul was, according to John Thomas Smith, the only
fashionable part of the town, and the residence of a great
number of persons of rank and title, and artists of the
first eminence; and also from the concourse of wits,
literary characters, and other men of genius, who frequented
the numerous coffee-houses, wine and cider
cellars, jelly-shops, etc., within its boundaries, the list
of whom particularly includes the eminent names of
Butler, Addison, Sir Richard Steele, Otway, Dryden,
Pope, Warburton, Cibber, Fielding, Churchill, Bolingbroke,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
and Dr. Samuel Johnson; Rich, Woodward,
Booth, Wilkes, Garrick, and Macklin; Kitty Clive,
Peg Woffington, Mrs. Pritchard, the Duchess of Bolton,
Lady Derby, Lady Thurlow, and the Duchess of St.
Alban's; Sir Peter Lely, Sir Godfrey Kneller, and Sir
James Thornhill; Vandevelde, Zincke, Lambert, Hogarth,
Hayman, Wilson, Dance, Meyer, etc. The name
of Samuel Foote should be added.</p>

<p>Although the high fashion of the old place has long
since ebbed away, its theatrical celebrity remains; and
the locality is storied with the dramatic associations of
two centuries. The Sublime Society of Steaks have
met upon this hallowed ground through a century; and
some thirty years ago there was established in the street
leading from the north-west angle of Covent-Garden
Market, a Club, bearing the name of our greatest actor.
Such was the Garrick Club, instituted in 1831, at No.
35, King-street, "for the purpose of bringing together
the 'patrons' of the drama and its professors, and also
for offering literary men a rendezvous; and the managers
of the Club have kept those general objects steadily
in view. Nearly all the leading actors are members,
and there are few of the active literary men of the day
who are not upon the list. The large majority of the
association is composed of the representatives of all the
best classes of society. The number of the members is
limited, and the character of the Club is social, and
therefore the electing committee is compelled to exercise
very vigilant care, for it is clear that it would be better
that ten unobjectionable men should be excluded than
that one terrible bore should be admitted. The prosperity
of the Club, and the eagerness to obtain admission
to it, are the best proofs of its healthy management; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
few of the cases of grievance alleged against the direction
will bear looking into."</p>

<p>The house in King-street was, previous to its occupation
by the Garrick men, a family hotel: it was rendered
tolerably commodious, but in course of time it was
found insufficient for the increased number of members;
and in 1864, the Club removed to a new house built for
them a little more westward than the old one. But of the
old place, inconvenient as it was, will long be preserved the
interest of association. The house has since been taken
down; but its memories are embalmed in a gracefully
written paper, by Mr. Shirley Brooks, which appeared
in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, immediately before the
removal of the Club to their new quarters; and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From James Smith (of <i>Rejected Addresses</i>) to
Thackeray, there is a long series of names of distinguished
men who have made the Garrick their favourite
haunt, and whose memories are connected with those
rooms. The visitor who has had the good fortune to be
taken through them, that he might examine the unequalled
collection of theatrical portraits, will also retain
a pleasant remembrance of the place. He will recollect
that he went up one side of a double flight of stone
steps from the street and entered a rather gloomy hall,
in which was a fine bust of Shakspeare, by Roubiliac,
and some busts of celebrated actors; and he may have
noticed in the hall a tablet recording the obligation of
the Club to Mr. Durrant, who bequeathed to it the
pictures collected by the late Charles Mathews. Conducted
to the left, the visitor found himself in the
strangers' dining-room, which occupied the whole of the
ground-floor. This apartment, where, perhaps, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
pleasant dinners had been given than in any room in
London, was closely hung with pictures. The newest
was Mr. O'Neil's admirable likeness of Mr. Keeley, and
it hung over the fireplace in the front room, near Sir
Edwin Landseer's portrait of Charles Young. There
were many very interesting pictures in this room, among
them a Peg Woffington; Lee (the author of the Bedlam
Tragedy, in nineteen acts); Mrs. Pritchard, and Mr.
Garrick, an admirable illustration of</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Pritchard's genteel, and Garrick six feet high;'</p>
</div>

<p>a most gentlemanly one of Pope the actor, Garrick again
as Macbeth in the court-dress, two charming little paintings
of Miss Poole when a child-performer, the late
Frederick Yates, Mrs. Davison (of rare beauty), Miss
Lydia Kelly, and a rich store besides. The stranger
would probably be next conducted through a long passage
until he reached the smoking-room, which was not
a cheerful apartment by daylight, and empty; but which
at night, and full, was thought the most cheerful apartment
in town. It was adorned with gifts from artists
who are members of the Club. Mr. Stanfield had given
a splendid seapiece, with a wash of waves that set one
coveting an excursion; and Mr. David Roberts had given
a large and noble painting of Baalbec, one of his finest
works. These great pictures occupied two sides of the
room, and the other walls were similarly ornamented.
Mrs. Stirling's bright face looked down upon the smokers,
and there was a statuette of one who loved the room&mdash;the
author of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p>

<p>"The visitor was then brought back to the hall, and
taken upstairs to the drawing-room floor. On the wall
as he passed he would observe a vast picture of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Charles Kemble (long a member) as Macbeth, and a
Miss O'Neil as Juliet. He entered the coffee-room, as
it was called, which was the front room, looking into
King-street, and behind which was the morning-room, for
newspapers and writing, and in which was the small but
excellent library, rich in dramatic works. The coffee-room
was devoted to the members' dinners; and the late
Mr. Thackeray dined for the last time away from home
at a table in a niche in which hung the scene from <i>The
Clandestine Marriage</i>, where Lord Ogleby is preparing
to join the ladies. Over the fireplace was another scene
from the same play; and on the mantelpiece were Garrick's
candlesticks, Kean's ring, and some other relics
of interest. The paintings in this room were very valuable.
There was Foote, by Reynolds; a Sheridan;
John Kemble; Charles Kemble as Charles II. (under
which picture he often sat in advanced life, when he in
no degree resembled the audacious, stalwart king in the
painting); Mrs. Charles Kemble, in male attire; Mrs.
Fitzwilliam; Charles Mathews, <i>père</i>; a fine, roystering
Woodward, reminding one of the rattling times of stage
chivalry and 'victorious burgundy;' and in the morning-room
was a delightful Kitty Clive, another Garrick, and,
near the ceiling, a row of strong faces of by-gone days&mdash;Cooke
the strongest.</p>

<p>"On the second floor were numerous small and very
characteristic portraits; and in a press full of large folios
was one of the completest and most valuable of collections
of theatrical prints. In the card-room, behind
this, were also some very quaint and curious likenesses,
one of Mrs. Liston, as Dollalolla. There was a sweet
face of 'the Prince's' Perdita, which excuses his infatuation
and aggravates his treachery. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
visitor had seen these things and a few busts, among
them one of the late Justice Talfourd (an old member),
he was informed that he had seen the collection and he
could go away, unless he were lucky enough to have an
invitation to dine in the strangers' room.</p>

<p>"The new Club-house is a little more westward than
the old one, but not much, the Garrick having resolved
to cling to the classic region around Covent-Garden. It
is in Garrick-street from the west end of King-street to
Cranbourn-street. It has a frontage of ninety-six feet
to the street; but the rear was very difficult, from its
shape, to manage, and Mr. Marrable, the architect, has
dealt very cleverly with the quaint form over which he
had to lay out his chambers. The house is Italian, and
is imposing, from having been judiciously and not over-enriched.
In the hall is a very beautiful Italian screen.
The noble staircase is of carved oak; at the top, a landing-place,
from which is entered the morning-room, the
card-room, and the library. All the apartments demanded
by the habits of the day&mdash;some of them were
not thought necessary in the days of Garrick&mdash;are, of
course provided. The kitchens and all their arrangements
are sumptuous, and the latest culinary improvements
are introduced. The system of sunlights appears
to be very complete, and devices for a perfect ventilation
have not been forgotten."</p>

<p>The pictures have been judiciously hung in the new
rooms: they include&mdash;Elliston as Octavian, by Singleton;
Macklin (aged 93), by Opie; Mrs. Pritchard, by
Hayman; Peg Woffington, by R. Wilson; Nell Gwynne,
by Sir Peter Lely; Mrs. Abington; Samuel Foote, by
Sir Joshua Reynolds; Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington;
Mrs. Bracegirdle; Kitty Clive; Mrs. Robinson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
after Reynolds; Garrick as Macbeth, and Mrs. Pritchard,
Lady Macbeth, by Zoffany; Garrick as Richard
III., by Morland, sen.; Young Roscius, by Opie; Quin,
by Hogarth; Rich and his family, by Hogarth; Charles
Mathews, four characters, by Harlowe; Nat Lee, painted
in Bedlam; Anthony Leigh as the Spanish Friar, by
Kneller; John Liston, by Clint; Munden, by Opie;
John Johnston, by Shee; Lacy in three characters, by
Wright; Scene from Charles II., by Clint; Mrs. Siddons
as Lady Macbeth, by Harlowe; J. P. Kemble as
Cato, by Lawrence; Macready as Henry IV., by Jackson;
Edwin, by Gainsborough; the twelve of the School
of Garrick; Kean, Young, Elliston, and Mrs. Inchbald,
by Harlowe; Garrick as Richard III., by Loutherbourg;
Rich as Harlequin; Moody and Parsons in
<i>The Committee</i>, by Vandergucht; King as Touchstone,
by Zoffany; Thomas Dogget; Henderson, by Gainsborough;
Elder Colman, by Reynolds; Mrs. Oldfield,
by Kneller; Mrs. Billington; Nancy Dawson; Screen
Scene from <i>The School for Scandal</i>, as originally cast;
Scene from <i>Venice Preserved</i> (Garrick and Mrs. Cibber),
by Zoffany; Scene from <i>Macbeth</i> (Henderson); Scene
from <i>Love, Law, and Physic</i> (Mathews, Liston, Blanchard,
and Emery), by Clint; Scene from <i>The Clandestine
Marriage</i> (King and Mr. and Mrs. Baddeley), by
Zoffany; Weston as Billy Button, by Zoffany.</p>

<p>The following have been presented to the Club:&mdash;Busts
of Mrs. Siddons and J. P. Kemble, by Mrs. Siddons;
of Garrick, Captain Marryat, Dr. Kitchiner, and Malibran;
Garrick, by Roubiliac; Griffin and Johnson in
<i>The Alchemist</i>, by Von Bleeck; Miniatures of Mrs. Robinson
and Peg Woffington; Sketch of Kean by Lambert;
Garrick Mulberry-tree Snuff-box; Joseph Harris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
as Cardinal Wolsey, from the Strawberry Hill Collection;
Proof Print of the Trial of Queen Katherine, by
Harlowe.</p>

<p>The Garrick men will, for the sake of justice, excuse
the mention of a short-coming: at the first dinner of the
Club, from the list of toasts was omitted "Shakspeare,"
who, it must be allowed, contributed to Garrick's fame.
David did not so forget the Bard, as is attested in his
statue by Roubiliac, which, after adorning the Garrick
grounds at Hampton, was bequeathed by the grateful
actor to the British Museum.</p>

<p>The Club were entertained at a sumptuous dinner by
their brother member, Lord Mayor Moon, in the Egyptian
Hall of the Mansion House, in 1855.</p>

<p>The Gin-punch made with iced soda-water, is a notable
potation at the Garrick; and the rightful patentee
of the invention was Mr. Stephen Price, an American
gentleman, well known on the turf, and as the lessee of
Drury-lane Theatre. His title has been much disputed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Grammatici certant et adhuc sub judice lis est;"</p>
</div>

<p>and many, misled by Mr. Theodore Hook's frequent and
liberal application of the discovery, were in the habit of
ascribing it to him. But, Mr. Thomas Hill, the celebrated
"trecentenarian" of a popular song, who was
present at Mr. Hook's first introduction to the beverage,
has set the matter at rest by a brief narration of the
circumstances. One hot afternoon, in July, 1835, the
inimitable author of <i>Sayings and Doings</i> (what a book
might be made of his own!) strolled into the Garrick
in that equivocal state of thirstiness which it requires
something more than common to quench. On describing
the sensation, he was recommended to make a trial of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the punch, and a jug was compounded immediately
under the personal inspection of Mr. Price. A second
followed&mdash;a third, with the accompaniment of some
chops&mdash;a fourth&mdash;a fifth&mdash;a sixth&mdash;at the expiration of
which Mr. Hook went away to keep a dinner engagement
at Lord Canterbury's. He always ate little, and
on this occasion he ate less, and Mr. Horace Twiss
inquired in a fitting tone of anxiety if he was ill. "Not
exactly," was the reply; "but my stomach won't bear
trifling with, and I was tempted to take a biscuit and a
glass of sherry about three."</p>

<p>The receipt for the gin punch is as follows:&mdash;pour half
a pint of gin on the outer peel of a lemon, then a little
lemon-juice, a glass of maraschino, about a pint and a
quarter of water, and two bottles of iced soda-water;
and the result will be three pints of the punch in question.</p>

<p>Another choice spirit of the Garrick was the aforesaid
Hill, "Tom Hill," as he was called by all who loved and
knew him. He "happened to know everything that
was going forward in all circles&mdash;mercantile, political,
fashionable, literary, or theatrical; in addition to all
matters connected with military and naval affairs, agriculture,
finance, art, and science&mdash;everything came alike
to him." He was born in 1760, and was many years a
drysalter at Queenhithe, but about 1810 he lost a large
sum of money by a speculation in indigo; after which he
retired upon the remains of his property, to chambers in
the Adelphi. While at Queenhithe, he found leisure to
make a fine collection of old books, chiefly old poetry,
which were valued at six thousand pounds. He greatly
assisted two friendless poets, Bloomfield and Kirke
White; he also established <i>The Monthly Mirror</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
brought him much into connection with dramatic poets,
actors, and managers, when he collected theatrical
curiosities and relics. Hill was the Hull of Hook's
clever novel, <i>Gilbert Gurney</i>, and the reputed original of
Paul Pry, though the latter is doubtful. The standard
joke about him was his age. He died in 1841, in his
eighty-first year, though Hook and all his friends always
affected to consider him as quite a Methuselah. James
Smith once said that it was impossible to discover his
age, for the parish-register had been burnt in the fire
of London; but Hook capped this:&mdash;'<i>Pooh, pooh!</i>&mdash;(Tom's
habitual exclamation)&mdash;he's one of the Little
Hills that are spoken of as skipping in the Psalms.' As
a mere octogenarian he was wonderful enough. No
human being would, from his appearance, gait, or habits,
have guessed him to be sixty. Till within three months
of his death, Hill rose at five usually, and brought the
materials of his breakfast home with him to the Adelphi
from a walk to Billingsgate; and at dinner he would eat
and drink like an adjutant of five-and-twenty. One
secret was, that a 'banyan-day' uniformly followed a
festivity. He then nursed himself most carefully on tea
and dry toast, tasted neither meat nor wine, and went to
bed by eight o'clock. But perhaps the grand secret
was, the easy, imperturbable serenity of his temper. He
had been kind and generous in the day of his wealth;
and though his evening was comparatively poor, his
cheerful heart kept its even beat.</p>

<p>Hill was a patient collector throughout his long life.
His old English poetry, which Southey considered the
rarest assemblage in existence, was dispersed in 1810;
and, after Hill's death, his literary rarities and memorials
occupied Evans, of Pall Mall, a clear week to sell by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
auction: the autograph letters were very interesting,
and among the memorials were Garrick's Shakspeare
Cup and a vase carved from the Bard's mulberry-tree;
and a block of wood from Pope's willow, at Twickenham.</p>

<p>Albert Smith was also of the Garrick, and usually
dined here before commencing his evening entertainment
at the Egyptian Hall, in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Smith was very clubbable, and with benevolent aims:
he was a leader of the Fielding Club, in Maiden-lane,
Covent Garden, which gave several amateur theatrical
representations, towards the establishment of "a Fund for
the immediate relief of emergencies in the Literary or
Theatrical world;" having already devoted a considerable
sum to charitable purposes. This plan of relieving
the woes of others through our own pleasures is a
touch of nature which yields twofold gratification.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE REFORM CLUB.</h2>

<p>This political Club was established by Liberal Members
of the two Houses of Parliament, to aid the carrying
of the Reform Bill, 1830-1832. It was temporarily
located in Great George-street, and Gwydyr House,
Whitehall, until towards the close of 1837, when designs
for a new Club-house were submitted by the architects,
Blore, Basevi, Cockerell, Sydney Smirke, and Barry.
The design of the latter was preferred, and the site selected
in Pall Mall, extending from the spot formerly
occupied by the temporary National Gallery (late the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
residence of Sir Walter Stirling), on one side of the
temporary Reform Club-house, over the vacant plot of
ground on the other side. The instructions were to
produce a Club-house which should surpass all others
in size and magnificence; one which should combine all
the attractions of other Clubs, such as baths, billiard-rooms,
smoking-rooms, with the ordinary accommodations;
besides the additional novelty of private chambers,
or dormitories. The frontage towards Pall Mall
is about 135 feet, or nearly equal to the frontage of the
Athenæum (76 feet) and the Travellers' (74 feet). The
style of the Reform is pure Italian, the architect having
taken some points from the celebrated Farnese Palace at
Rome, designed by Michael Angelo Buonarroti, in 1545,
and built by Antonio Sangallo. However, the resemblance
between the two edifices has been greatly over-stated,
it consisting only in both of them being astylar,
with columnar-decorated fenestration. The exterior is
greatly admired; though it is objected, and with reason,
that the windows are too small. The Club-house contains
six floors and 134 apartments: the basement and
mezzanine below the street pavement, and the chambers
in the roof are not seen.</p>

<p>The points most admired are extreme simplicity and
unity of design, combined with very unusual richness.
The breadth of the piers between the windows contributes
not a little to that repose which is so essential to
simplicity, and hardly less so to stateliness. The string-courses
are particularly beautiful, while the cornicione
(68 feet from the pavement) gives extraordinary majesty
and grandeur to the whole. The roof is covered with
Italian tiles; the edifice is faced throughout with Portland
stone, and is a very fine specimen of masonry. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
building it a strong scaffolding was constructed, and on
the top was laid a railway, upon which was worked a
traversing crane, movable along the building either longitudinally
or transversely; by which means the stones
were raised from the ground, and placed on the wall
with very little labour to the mason, who had only to
adjust the bed and lay the block.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In the centre of the interior is a grand hall, 56 by 50,
(the entire height of the building,) resembling an Italian
<i>cortile</i>, surrounded by colonnades, below Ionic, and above
Corinthian; the latter is a picture-gallery, where, inserted
in the scagliola walls, are whole-length portraits
of eminent political Reformers; while the upper colonnade
has rich floral mouldings, and frescoes of Music,
Poetry, Painting, and sculpture, by Parris. The floor
of the hall is tessellated; and the entire roof is strong
diapered flint-glass, executed by Pellatt, at the cost of
600<i>l.</i> The staircase, like that of an Italian palace, leads
to the upper gallery of the hall, opening into the principal
drawing-room, which is over the coffee-room in the
garden-front, both being the entire length of the building;
adjoining are a library, card-room, etc., over the
library and dining-rooms. Above are a billiard-room
and lodging-rooms for members of the Club; there
being a separate entrance to the latter by a lodge adjoining
the Travellers' Club-house.</p>

<p>The basement comprises two-storied wine-cellars beneath
the hall; besides the kitchen department, planned
by Alexis Soyer, originally <i>chef-de-cuisine</i> of the Club:
it contains novel employments of steam and gas, and
mechanical applications of practical ingenuity; the inspection
of which was long one of the privileged sights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
of London. The <i>cuisine</i>, under M. Soyer, enjoyed European
fame. Soyer first came to England on a visit to
his brother, who was then cook to the Duke of Cambridge;
and at Cambridge House, Alexis cooked his first
dinner in England, for the then Prince George. Soyer
afterwards entered the service of various noblemen,
amongst others of Lord Ailsa, Lord Panmure, etc. He
then entered into the service of the Reform Club, and
the breakfast given by that Club on the occasion of the
Queen's Coronation obtained him high commendation.
His ingenuity gave a sort of celebrity to the great political
banquets given at the Reform. In his O'Connell
dinner, the <i>soufflés à la Clontarf</i>, were considered by
gastronomes to be a rich bit of satire. The banquet to
Ibrahim Pacha, July 3, 1846, was another of Soyer's great
successes, when Merlans à l'Égyptienne, la Crême
d'Égypte and à l'Ibrahim Pacha, mingled with Le Gâteau
Britannique à l'Amiral (Napier). Another famous
banquet was that given to Sir C. Napier, March 3, 1854,
as Commander of the Baltic Fleet; and the banquet
given July 20, 1850, to Viscount Palmerston, who was
a popular leader of the Reform, was, gastronomically as
well as politically, a brilliant triumph. It was upon this
memorable occasion that Mr. Bernal Osborne characterized
the Palmerston policy in this quotation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Warmed by the instincts of a knightly heart,</p>
<p class="i1">That roused at once if insult touched the realm,</p>
<p>He spurned each State-craft, each deceiving art,</p>
<p class="i1">And met his foes no vizor to his helm.</p>
<p>This proved his worth, hereafter be our boast&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Who hated Britons, hated him the most."</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Palmerston was too true an Englishman to be
insensible to "the pleasures of the table," as attested by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the hospitalities of Cambridge House, during his administration.
One of his Lordship's political opponents,
writing in 1836, says: "Lord Palmerston is redeemed
from the last extremity of political degradation by his
cook." A distinguished member of the diplomatic body
was once overheard remarking to an Austrian nobleman,
upon the Minister's shortcomings in some respects,
adding, "mais on dîne fort bien chez lui."</p>

<p>It is always interesting to read a foreigner's opinion
of English society. The following observations, by the
Viscountess de Malleville, appeared originally in the
<i>Courrier de l'Europe</i>, and preceded an account of the
Reform. Commencing with Clubs, the writer remarks:</p>

<p>"It cannot be denied that these assemblages, wealthy
and widely extended in their ramifications, selfish in
principle, but perfectly adapted to the habits of the nation,
offer valuable advantages to those who have the
good fortune to be enrolled in them.... The social
state and manners of the country gave the first idea of
them. The spirit of association which is so inherent in
the British character, did the rest. It is only within the
precincts of these splendid edifices, where all the requirements
of opulent life, all the comforts and luxuries of
princely habitations are combined, that we can adequately
appreciate the advantages and the complicated results
produced by such a system of association. For an annual
subscription, comparatively of small amount, every
member of a Club is admitted into a circle, which is enlivened
and renewed from time to time by the accession
of strangers of distinction. A well-selected and extensive
library, newspapers and pamphlets from all parts of
the world, assist him to pass the hours of leisure and
digestion. According as his tastes incline, a man may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
amuse himself in the saloons devoted to play, to reading,
or to conversation. In a word, the happy man, who
only goes to get his dinner, may drink the best wines
out of the finest cut-glass, and may eat the daintiest and
best-cooked viands off the most costly plate, at such
moderate prices as no Parisian restaurateur could afford.
The advantages of a Club do not end here: it becomes
for each of its members a second domestic hearth, where
the cares of business and household annoyances cannot
assail him. As a retreat especially sacred against the
visitations of idle acquaintances and tiresome creditors&mdash;a
sanctuary in which each member feels himself in
the society of those who act and sympathize with him&mdash;the
Club will ever remain a resort, tranquil, elegant,
and exclusive; interdicted to the humble and to the insignificant."</p>

<p>The writer then proceeds to illustrate the sumptuous
character of our new Club-houses by reference to the
Reform. "Unlike in most English buildings, the staircase
is wide and commodious, and calls to mind that of
the Louvre. The quadrangular apartment which terminates
it, is surrounded by spacious galleries; the rich
mosaic pavement, in which the brilliancy of the colour
is only surpassed by the variety of the design&mdash;the cut-glass
ceiling, supported by four rows of marble pillars&mdash;all
these things call to remembrance the most magnificent
apartments of Versailles in the days of the great
king and his splendours. This is the vestibule, which is
the grand feature of the mansion." The kitchen is then
described&mdash;"spacious as a ball-room, kept in the finest
order, and white as a young bride. All-powerful steam,
the noise of which salutes your ear as you enter, here
performs a variety of offices: it diffuses a uniform heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
to large rows of dishes, warms the metal plates upon
which are disposed the dishes that have been called for,
and that are in waiting to be sent above: it turns the
spits, draws the water, carries up the coal, and moves the
plate like an intelligent and indefatigable servant. Stay
awhile before this octagonal apparatus, which occupies
the centre of the place. Around you the water boils
and the stew-pans bubble, and a little further on is a
moveable furnace, before which pieces of meat are converted
into savoury <i>rôtis</i>; here are sauces and gravies,
stews, broths, soups, etc. In the distance are Dutch
ovens, marble mortars, lighted stoves, iced plates of
metal for fish; and various compartments for vegetables,
fruits, roots, and spices. After this inadequate, though
prodigious nomenclature, the reader may perhaps picture
to himself a state of general confusion, a disordered assemblage,
resembling that of a heap of oyster-shells.
If so, he is mistaken; for, in fact, you see very little, or
scarcely anything of all the objects above described. The
order of their arrangement is so perfect, their distribution
as a whole, and in their relative bearings to one
another, all are so intelligently considered, that you require
the aid of a guide to direct you in exploring them,
and a good deal of time to classify in your mind all
your discoveries.</p>

<p>"Let all strangers who come to London for business,
or pleasure, or curiosity, or for whatever cause, not fail
to visit the Reform Club. In an age of utilitarianism,
and of the search for the comfortable, like ours, there is
more to be learned here than in the ruins of the Coliseum,
of the Parthenon, or of Memphis."

<h2>THE CARLTON CLUB.</h2>

<p>The Carlton is purely a political Club, and was founded
by the great Duke of Wellington, and a few of his most
intimate political friends. It held its first meeting in
Charles-street, St. James's, in the year 1831. In the
following year it removed to larger premises, Lord Kensington's,
in Carlton Gardens. In 1836, an entirely
new house was built for the Club, in Pall-Mall, by Sir
Robert Smirke, R.A.: it was of small extent, and plain
and inexpensive. As the Club grew in numbers and
importance, the building became inadequate to its wants.
In 1846, a very large addition was made to it by Mr.
Sydney Smirke; and in 1854, the whole of the original
edifice was taken down, and rebuilt by Mr. Smirke, upon
a sumptuous scale; and it will be the largest, though
not the most costly Club-house, in the metropolis. It
is a copy of Sansovino's Library of St. Mark, at Venice:
the entablature of the Ionic, or upper order, is considerably
more ponderous than that of the Doric below,
which is an unorthodox defect. The façade is highly
enriched, and exhibits a novelty in the shafts of all the
columns being of red Peterhead granite, highly polished,
which, in contrast with the dead stone, is objectionable:
"cloth of frieze and cloth of gold" do not wear well
together. In the garden front the pilasters, which take
the place of columns in the entrance front and flank,
are of the same material as the latter, namely, Peterhead
granite, polished. Many predictions were at first
ventured upon as to the perishable nature of the lustre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of the polished granite shafts; but these predictions have
been falsified by time; nine years' exposure having
produced no effect whatever on the polished surface.
Probably the polish itself is the protection of the granite,
by preventing moisture from hanging on the surface.</p>

<p>The Carlton contains Conservatives of every hue, from
the good old-fashioned Tory to the liberal progressist of
the latest movements,&mdash;men of high position in fortune
and politics.</p>

<p>Some thirty years ago, a <i>Quarterly</i> reviewer wrote:
"The improvement and multiplication of Clubs is the
grand feature of metropolitan progress. There are between
twenty and thirty of these admirable establishments,
at which a man of moderate habits can dine
more comfortably for three or four shillings (including
half a pint of wine), than he could have dined for four
or five times that amount at the coffee-houses and hotels,
which were the habitual resort of the bachelor class in
the corresponding rank of life during the first quarter
of the century. At some of the Clubs&mdash;the Travellers',
the Coventry, and the Carlton, for example&mdash;the most
finished luxury may be enjoyed at a very moderate cost.
The best judges are agreed that it is utterly impossible
to dine better than at the Carlton, when the cook has
fair notice, and is not hurried, or confused by a multitude
of orders. But great allowances must be made
when a simultaneous rush occurs from both Houses of
Parliament; and the caprices of individual members of
such institutions are sometimes extremely trying to the
temper and reputation of a <i>chef</i>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE CONSERVATIVE CLUB.</h2>

<p>This handsome Club-house, which occupies a portion
of the site of the old Thatched House Tavern, 74, St.
James's-street, was designed by Sydney Smirke and
George Basevi, 1845. The upper portion is Corinthian,
with columns and pilasters, and a frieze sculptured with
the imperial crown and oak-wreaths; the lower order is
Roman-Doric; and the wings are slightly advanced,
with an enriched entrance-porch north, and a bay-window
south. The interior was superbly decorated in
colour by Sang: the coved hall, with a gallery round
it, and the domed vestibule above it, is a fine specimen
of German encaustic embellishment, in the arches, soffites,
spandrels, and ceilings; and the hall-floor is tessellated,
around a noble star of marqueterie. The
evening room, on the first floor, has an enriched
coved ceiling, and a beautiful frieze of the rose, shamrock,
and thistle, supported by scagliola Corinthian columns:
the morning room, beneath, is of the same dimensions,
with Ionic pillars. The library, in the upper
story north, has columns and pilasters with bronzed
capitals. Beneath is the coffee-room. The kitchen is
far more spacious than that of the Reform Club. In
the right wing is a large bay-window, which was introduced
as an essential to the morning room, affording
the lounger a view of Pall Mall and St. James's-street,
and the Palace gateway; this introduction reminding
us, by the way, of Theodore Hook's oddly comparing
the bay-window of a coffee-house nearly on the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
spot, to an obese old gentleman in a white waistcoat.
Hook lived for some time in Cleveland-row: he used to
describe the <i>real London</i> as the space between Pall Mall
on the south, Piccadilly north, St. James's west, and
the Opera-house east.</p>

<p>This is the second Club of the Conservative party,
and many of its chiefs are honorary members, but rarely
enter it: Sir Robert Peel is said never to have entered
this Club-house except to view the interior. Other leaders
have, however, availed themselves of the Club influences
to recruit their ranks from its working strength. This
has been political ground for a century and a half; for
here, at the Thatched House Tavern, Swift met his
political Clubs, and dined with Tory magnates; but
with fewer appliances than in the present day; in Swift's
time "the wine being always brought by him that is
president."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h2>THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE CLUB.</h2>

<p>The Oxford and Cambridge Club-house, 71, Pall Mall,
for members of the two Universities, was designed by
Sir Robert Smirke, R.A., and his brother, Mr. Sydney
Smirke, 1835-8. The Pall Mall façade is 80 feet in
width by 75 in height, and the rear lies over against the
court of Marlborough House. The ornamental detail is
very rich: as the entrance-portico, with Corinthian columns;
the balcony, with its panels of metal foliage; and
the ground-story frieze, and arms of Oxford and Cambridge
Universities over the portico columns. The upper
part of the building has a delicate Corinthian entablature
and balustrade; and above the principal windows are
bas-reliefs in panels, executed in cement by Nicholl,
from designs by Sir R. Smirke, as follows:&mdash;Centre
panel: Minerva and Apollo presiding on Mount Parnassus;
and the River Helicon, surrounded by the Muses.
Extreme panels: Homer singing to a warrior, a female,
and a youth; Virgil singing his Georgics to a group of
peasants. Other four panels: Milton reciting to his
daughter; Shakspeare attended by Tragedy and Comedy;
Newton explaining his system; Bacon, his philosophy.
Beneath the ground-floor is a basement of offices, and an
entresol or mezzanine of chambers. The principal apartments
are tastefully decorated; the drawing-room is
panelled with <i>papier mâché</i>; and the libraries are filled
with book-cases of beautifully-marked Russian birchwood.
From the back library is a view of Marlborough
House and its gardens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE GUARDS' CLUB.</h2>

<p>Was formerly housed in St. James's-street, next Crockford's,
north; but, in 1850, they removed to Pall Mall,
No. 70. The new Club-house was designed for them
by Henry Harrison, and remarkable for its compactness
and convenience, although its size and external appearance
indicate no more than a private house. The architect
has adopted some portion of a design of Sansovino's
in the lower part or basement.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE ARMY AND NAVY CLUB.</h2>

<p>The Army and Navy Club-house, Pall Mall, corner of
George-street, designed by Parnell and Smith, was opened
February 1851. The exterior is a combination from
Sansovino's Palazzo Cornaro, and Library of St. Mark
at Venice; but varying in the upper part, which has
Corinthian columns, with windows resembling arcades
filling up the intercolumns; and over their arched headings
are groups of naval and military symbols, weapons,
and defensive armour&mdash;very picturesque. The frieze has
also effective groups symbolic of the Army and Navy;
the cornice, likewise very bold, is crowned by a massive
balustrade. The basement, from the Cornaro, is rusticated;
the entrance being in the centre of the east or
George-street front, by three open arches, similar in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
character to those in the Strand front of Somerset House.
The whole is extremely rich in ornamental detail. The
hall is fine; the coffee-room is panelled with scagliola,
and has a ceiling enriched with flowers, and pierced for
ventilation by heated flues above; adjoining is a room
lighted by a glazed plafond; next is the house dining-room,
decorated in the Munich style; and more superb
is the morning-room, with its arched windows, and
mirrors forming arcades and vistas innumerable. A
magnificent stone staircase leads to the library and
reading rooms; and in the third story are billiard and
card rooms; and a smoking-room, with a lofty dome
elaborately decorated in traceried Moresque. The apartments
are adorned with an equestrian portrait of Queen
Victoria, painted by Grant, R.A.; a piece of Gobelin
tapestry (Sacrifice to Diana), presented to the Club in
1849 by Prince Louis Napoleon; marble busts of William
IV. and the Dukes of Kent and Cambridge; and
several life-size portraits of naval and military heroes.
The Club-house is provided with twenty lines of Whishaw's
Telekouphona, or Speaking Telegraph, which
communicate from the Secretary's room to the various
apartments. The cost of this superb edifice, exclusive of
fittings, was 35,000<i>l.</i>; the plot of ground on which it
stands cost the Club 52,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The Club system has added several noble specimens
of ornate architecture to the metropolis; to the south
side of Pall Mall these fine edifices have given a truly
patrician air. But, it is remarkable that while both
parties political have contributed magnificent edifices
towards the metropolis and their opinions; while the
Conservatives can show with pride two splendid piles
and the Liberals at least one handsome one; while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Army and Navy have recently a third palace&mdash;the
most successful of the three they can boast; while the
Universities, the sciences, even our Indian empire,
come forward, the fashionable clubs, the aristocratic
clubs do nothing for the general aspect of London, and
have made no move in a direction where they ought to
have been first. Can anything be more paltry than that
bay-window from which the members of White's contemplate
the cabstand and the Wellington Tavern? and
yet a little management might make that house worthy
of its unparalleled situation; and if it were extended to
Piccadilly, it would be the finest thing of its kind in
Europe.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE JUNIOR UNITED SERVICE CLUB.</h2>

<p>At the corner of Charles-street and Regent-street, was
erected in 1855-57, Nelson and James, architects, and
has a most embellished exterior, enriched with characteristic
sculpture by John Thomas. The design is described
in the <i>Builder</i> as in the Italian style of architecture, the
bay-window in Regent-street forming a prominent feature
in the composition, above which is a sculptured
group allegorical of the Army and Navy. The whole of
the sculpture and ornamental details throughout the
building are characteristic of the profession of the members
of the Club. The exterior of the building is surmounted
by a richly-sculptured cornice, with modillion
and dentils, and beneath it an elaborate frieze, having
medallions with trophies and other suitable emblems,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
separated from each other by the rose, shamrock, and
thistle. The external walls of the building are of Bath
stone, and the balustrade round the area is of Portland
stone; and upon the angle-pieces of this are bronze
lamps, supported by figures. The staircase is lighted
from the top by a handsome lantern, filled with painted
glass, with an elaborate coved and ornamented ceiling
around. On the landing of the half space are two
pairs of caryatidal figures, and single figures against the
walls, supporting three semicircular arches, and the
whole is reflected by looking-glasses on the landing.
On the upper landing of the staircase, is the celebrated
picture, by Allan, of the Battle of Waterloo. Upon the
first floor fronting Regent-street, and over the morning-room,
and of the same dimensions, is the evening-room,
which is also used as a picture-gallery, 24 feet high, with
a bay-window fronting Regent-street. In the gallery are
portraits of military and naval commanders; Queen Victoria
and Prince Albert, and the Emperor Napoleon;
and an allegorical group in silver, presented to the Club
by his Imperial Majesty.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>CROCKFORD'S CLUB.</h2>

<p>This noted gaming Club-house, No. 50, on the west
side of St. James's-street, over against White's, was built
for Mr. Crockford, in 1827; B. and P. Wyatt, architects.</p>

<p>Crockford started in life as a fishmonger, at the old
bulk-shop next-door to Temple Bar Without, which he
quitted for play in St. James's. "For several years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
deep play went on at all the Clubs&mdash;fluctuating both as
to locality and amount&mdash;till by degrees it began to flag.
It was at a low ebb when Mr. Crockford laid the foundation
of the most colossal fortune that was ever made by
play. He began by taking Watier's old Club-house, in
partnership with a man named Taylor. They set up a
hazard-bank, and won a great deal of money, but quarrelled
and separated at the end of the first year. Taylor
continued where he was, had a bad year, and failed.
Crockford removed to St. James's-street, had a good
year, and immediately set about building the magnificent
Club-house which bears his name. It rose like a creation
of Aladdin's lamp; and the genii themselves could
hardly have surpassed the beauty of the internal decorations,
or furnished a more accomplished <i>maître d'hôtel</i>
than Ude. To make the company as select as possible,
the establishment was regularly organized as a Club, and
the election of members vested in a committee. 'Crockford's'
became the rage, and the votaries of fashion,
whether they liked play or not, hastened to enrol themselves.
The Duke of Wellington was an original member,
though (unlike Blücher, who repeatedly lost everything
he had at play) the great Captain was never known
to play deep at any game but war or politics. Card-tables
were regularly placed, and whist was played occasionally;
but the aim, end, and final cause of the whole
was the hazard-bank, at which the proprietor took his
nightly stand, prepared for all comers. <i>Le Wellington
des Joueurs</i> lost 23,000<i>l.</i> at a sitting, beginning at twelve
at night, and ending at seven the following evening. He
and three other noblemen could not have lost less, sooner
or later, than 100,000<i>l.</i> apiece. Others lost in proportion
(or out of proportion) to their means; but we leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
it to less occupied moralists, and better calculators, to say
how many ruined families went to make Mr. Crockford
a <i>millionnaire</i>&mdash;for a <i>millionnaire</i> he was in the English
sense of the term, after making the largest possible allowance
for bad debts. A vast sum, perhaps half a million,
was sometimes due to him; but as he won, all his
debtors were able to raise, and easy credit was the most
fatal of his lures. He retired in 1840, much as an Indian
chief retires from a hunting country when there is
not game enough left for his tribe, and the Club is now
tottering to its fall."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The Club-house consists of two wings and a centre,
with four Corinthian pilasters, and entablature, and a
balustrade throughout; the ground-floor has Venetian
windows, and the upper story, large French windows.
The entrance-hall had a screen of Roman-Ionic scagliola
columns with gilt capitals, and a cupola of gilding and
stained glass. The library has Sienna columns and antæ
of the Ionic order, from the Temple of Minerva Polias;
the staircase is panelled with scagliola, and enriched with
Corinthian columns. The grand drawing-room is in
the style of Louis Quatorze: azure ground, with elaborate
cove; ceiling enrichments bronze gilt; door-way
paintings <i>à la Watteau</i>; and panelling, masks, terminals,
heavily gilt. Upon the opening of the Club-house, it
was described in the exaggerated style, as "the New
Pandemonium"; the drawing-rooms, or real Hell, consisting
of four chambers; the first an ante-room, opening
to a saloon embellished to a degree which baffles description;
thence to a small, curiously-formed cabinet, or
boudoir, which opens to the supper room. All these
rooms are panelled in the most gorgeous manner, spaces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
being left to be filled up with mirrors, silk or gold enrichments;
the ceilings being as superb as the walls. A
billiard-room on the upper floor completes the number of
apartments professedly dedicated to the use of the members.
Whenever any secret man&oelig;uvre is to be carried
on, there are smaller and more retired places, both under
this roof and the next, whose walls will tell no tales.</p>

<p>The <i>cuisine</i> at Crockford's was of the highest class,
and the members were occasionally very <i>exigeant</i>, and
trying to the patience of M. Ude. At one period of his
presidency, a ground of complaint, formally addressed to
the Committee, was that there was an admixture of
onion in the <i>soubise</i>. Colonel Damer, happening to enter
Crockford's one evening to dine early, found Ude walking
up and down in a towering passion, and naturally
inquired what was the matter. "No matter, Monsieur
le Colonel! Did you see that man who has just gone
out? Well, he ordered a red mullet for his dinner. I
made him a delicious little sauce with my own hands.
The price of the mullet marked on the <i>carte</i> was 2<i>s.</i>;
I asked 6<i>d.</i> for the sauce. He refuses to pay the 6<i>d.</i>
That <i>imbécille</i> apparently believes that the red mullets
come out of the sea with my sauce in their pockets!"
The <i>imbécille</i> might have retorted that they do come out
of the sea with their appropriate sauce in their pockets;
but this forms no excuse for damaging the consummate
genius of a Ude.</p>

<p>The appetites of some Club members appear to entitle
them to be called <i>gourmands</i> rather than <i>gourmets</i>. Of
such a member of Crockford's the following traits are
related in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. 110:&mdash;"The Lord-lieutenant
of one of the western counties eats a covey
of partridges for breakfast every day during the season;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and there is a popular M.P. at present [1836] about
town who would eat a covey of partridges, as the
Scotchman ate a dozen of becaficos, for a whet, and feel
himself astonished if his appetite was not accelerated by
the circumstance. Most people must have seen or heard
of a caricature representing a gentleman at dinner upon
a round of beef, with the landlord looking on. 'Capital
beef, landlord!' says the gentleman; 'a man may
cut and come again here.' 'You may cut, Sir,' responds
Boniface; 'but I'm blow'd if you shall come again.'
The person represented is the M.P. in question; and
the sketch is founded upon fact. He had occasion to
stay late in the City, and walked into the celebrated
Old Bailey beef-shop on his return, where, according to
the landlord's computation, he demolished about seven
pounds and a half of solid meat, with a proportionate
allowance of greens. His exploits at Crockford's have
been such, that the founder of that singular institution
has more than once had serious thoughts of giving him
a guinea to sup elsewhere; and has only been prevented
by the fear of meeting with a rebuff similar to that mentioned
in <i>Roderick Random</i> as received by the master of
an ordinary, who, on proposing to buy off an ugly customer,
was informed by him that he had already been
bought off by all the other ordinaries in town, and was
consequently under the absolute necessity of continuing
to patronize the establishment."</p>

<p>Theodore Hook was a frequent visitor at Crockford's,
where play did not begin till late. Mr. Barham describes
him, after going the round of the Clubs, proposing,
with some gay companion, to finish with half an
hour at Crockford's: "The half-hour is quadrupled, and
the excitement of the preceding evening was nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
that which now ensued." He had a receipt of his own
to prevent being exposed to the night air. "I was very
ill," he once said, "some months ago, and my doctor
gave me particular orders not to expose myself to it;
so I come up [from Fulham] every day to Crockford's,
or some other place to dinner, and I make it a rule on
no account to go home again till about four or five
o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>After Crockford's death, the Club-house was sold by
his executors for 2,900<i>l.</i>; held on lease, of which thirty-two
years were unexpired, subject to a yearly rent of
1,400<i>l.</i> It is said that the decorations alone cost 94,000<i>l.</i>
The interior was re-decorated in 1849, and opened for
the Military, Naval, and County Service Club, but was
closed again in 1851. It has been, for several years, a
dining-house&mdash;"the Wellington."</p>

<p>Crockford's old bulk-shop, west of Temple-bar, was
taken down in 1846. It is engraved in Archer's <i>Vestiges of
London</i>, part i. A view in 1795, in the Crowle Pennant,
presents one tall gable to the street; but the pitch of
the roof had been diminished by adding two imperfect
side gables. The heavy pents originally traversed over
each of the three courses of windows; it was a mere
timber frame filled up with lath and plaster, the beams
being of deal with short oak joints: it presented a capital
example of the old London bulk-shop (sixteenth century),
with a heavy canopy projecting over the pathway,
and turned up at the rim to carry off the rain endwise.
This shop had long been held by a succession of fishmongers;
and Crockford would not permit the house-front
to be altered in his lifetime. He was known in
gaming circles by the sobriquet of "the Fishmonger."

<h2>"KING ALLEN," "THE GOLDEN BALL,"
AND SCROPE DAVIES.</h2>

<p>In the old days when gaming was in fashion, at
Watier's Club, princes and nobles lost or gained fortunes
between themselves. It was the same at Brookes's, one
member of which, Lord Robert Spencer, was wise enough
to apply what he had won to the purchase of the estate
of Woolbidding, Suffolk. Then came Crockford's hell,
the proprietor of which, a man who had begun life with
a fish-basket, won the whole of the ready money of
the then existing generation of aristocratic simpletons.
Among the men who most suffered by play was Viscount
Allen, or 'King Allen,' as he was called. This effeminate
dandy had fought like a young lion in Spain; for
the dandies, foolish as they looked, never wanted pluck.
The 'King' then lounged about town, grew fat, lost his
all, and withdrew to Dublin, where, in Merrion-square,
he slept behind a large brass plate with 'Viscount
Allen' upon it, which was as good to him as board
wages, for it brought endless invitations from people
eager to feed a viscount at any hour of the day or night,
although King Allen had more ready ability in uttering
disagreeable than witty things.</p>

<p>Very rarely indeed did any of the ruined gamesters
ever get on their legs again. The Golden Ball, however,
was an exception. Ball Hughes fell from the very
top of the gay pagoda into the mud, but even there, as
life was nothing to him without the old excitement, he
played pitch and toss for halfpence, and he won and lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
small ventures at battledore and shuttlecock, which innocent
exercise he turned into a gambling speculation.
After he withdrew, in very reduced circumstances, to
France, his once mad purchase of Oatlands suddenly
assumed a profitable aspect. The estate was touched by
a railway and admired by building speculators, and between
the two the Ball, in its last days, had a very cheerful
and glittering aspect indeed.</p>

<p>Far less lucky than Hughes was Scrope Davies,
whose name was once so familiar to every man and boy
about town. There was good stuff about this dandy.
He one night won the whole fortune of an aspiring fast
lad who had come of age the week before, and who was
so prostrated by his loss that kindly-hearted Scrope gave
back the fortune the other had lost, on his giving his
word of honour never to play again. Davies stuck to
the green baize till his own fortune had gone among a
score of less compassionate gentlemen. His distressed
condition was made known to the young fellow to whom
he had formerly acted with so much generosity, and
that grateful heir refused to lend him even a guinea.
Scrope was not of the gentlemen-ruffians of the day
who were addicted to cruelly assaulting men weaker than
themselves. He was well-bred and a scholar; and he
bore his reverses with a rare philosophy. His home
was on a bench in the Tuileries, where he received old
acquaintances who visited him in exile; but he admitted
only very tried friends to the little room where he read
and slept. He was famed for his readiness in quoting
the classical poets, and for his admiration of Moore, in
whose favour those quotations were frequently made.
They were often most happy. For example, he translated
'Ubi <i>plura</i> nitent non ego <i>paucis</i> offendar maculis,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
by '<i>Moore shines so brightly that I cannot find fault with
Little's vagaries</i>!' He also rendered 'Ne <i>plus</i> ultra,'
'<i>Nothing is better than Moore!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h2>THE FOUR-IN-HAND CLUB.</h2>

<p>Gentleman-coaching has scarcely been known in England
seventy years. The Anglo-Erichthonius, the Hon.
Charles Finch, brother to the Earl of Aylesford, used to
drive his own coach-and-four, disguised in a livery great-coat.
Soon after his <i>début</i>, however, the celebrated
"Tommy Onslow," Sir John Lacy, and others, mounted
the box in their own characters. Sir John was esteemed
a renowned judge of coach-horses and carriages, and a
coachman of the old school; but everything connected
with the coach-box has undergone such a change, that
the Nestors of the art are no longer to be quoted. Among
the celebrities may be mentioned the "B. C. D.," or
Benson Driving Club, which held its rendezvous at the
"Black Dog," Bedfont, as one of the numerous driving
associations, whose processions used, some five-and-thirty
years ago, to be among the most imposing, as
well as peculiar, spectacles in and about the metropolis.</p>

<p>On the stage, the gentlemen drivers, of whom the
members of the Four-in-Hand Club were the exclusive
<i>élite</i>, were illustrated rather than caricatured in <i>Goldfinch</i>,
in Holcroft's comedy <i>The Road to Ruin</i>. Some of them
who had not "drags" of their own, "tipped" a weekly
allowance to stage coachmen, to allow them to "finger
the ribbons," and "tool the team." Of course, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
frequently "spilt" the passengers. The closeness with
which the professional coachmen were imitated by the
"bucks," is shown in the case of wealthy young Ackers,
who had one of his front teeth taken out, in order that
he might acquire the true coachman-like way of "spitting."
There were men of brains, nevertheless, in the
Four-in-Hand, who knew how to ridicule such fellow-members
as Lord Onslow, whom they thus immortalized
in an epigram of that day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"What can Tommy Onslow do?</p>
<p>He can drive a coach and two!</p>
<p>Can Tommy Onslow do no more?</p>
<p>He can drive a coach and four."</p>
</div>

<p>It is a curious fact, that the fashion of amateur charioteering
was first set by the ladies. Dr. Young has
strikingly sketched, in his satires, the Delia who was as
good a coachman as the man she paid for being so:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Graceful as John, she moderates the reins,</p>
<p>And whistles sweet her diuretic strains."</p>
</div>

<p>The Four-in-Hand combined gastronomy with equestrianism
and charioteering. They always drove out of
town to dinner, and the ghost of Scrope Davies will
pardon our suggesting that the club of drivers and diners
might well have taken for their motto, "Quadrigis,
petimus bene vivere!"<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>There is another version of the epigram on Tom Onslow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Say, what can Tommy Onslow do?</p>
<p>Can drive a curricle and two.</p>
<p>Can Tommy Onslow do no more?</p>
<p>Yes,&mdash;drive a curricle and four."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>This is the version current, we are told, among Onslow's
relations in the neighbourhood of Guildford.</p>

<p>Lord Onslow's celebrity as <i>a whip</i> long preceded the
existence of the Four-in-Hand Club (the palmy days of
which belong to the times of George the Fourth), and it
was not a <i>coach</i>, but a <i>phaeton</i>, that he drove. A correspondent
of the <i>Athenæum</i> writes: "I knew him personally,
in my own boyhood, in Surrey, in the first years
of the present century; and I remember then hearing the
epigram now referred to, not as new, but as well known,
in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'What can little T. O. do?</p>
<p>Drive a phaeton and two.</p>
<p>Can little T. O. do no more?</p>
<p>Yes,&mdash;drive a phaeton and four.'</p>
</div>

<p>"Tommy Onslow was a little man, full of life and oddities,
one of which was a fondness for driving into odd
places; and I remember the surprise of a pic-nic party,
which he joined in a secluded spot, driving up in his
'phaeton and four' through ways that were hardly supposed
passable by anything beyond a flock of sheep.
An earlier exploit of his had a less agreeable termination.
He was once driving through Thames-street, when the
hook of a crane, dangling down in front of one of the
warehouses, caught the hood of the phaeton, tilting him
out, and the fall broke his collar-bone."</p>

<p>The vehicles of the Club which were formerly used
are described as of a hybrid class, quite as elegant as
private carriages and lighter than even the mails. They
were horsed with the finest animals that money could
secure. In general, the whole four in each carriage
were admirably matched; grey and chestnut were the
favourite colours, but occasionally very black horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
or such as were freely flecked with white, were preferred.
The master generally drove the team, often a nobleman
of high rank, who commonly copied the dress of a mail
coachman. The company usually rode outside, but two
footmen in rich liveries were indispensable on the back
seat, nor was it at all uncommon to see some splendidly
attired female on the box. A rule of the Club was that
all members should turn out three times a week; and
the start was made at mid-day, from the neighbourhood
of Piccadilly, through which they passed to the
Windsor-road,&mdash;the attendants of each carriage playing
on their silver bugles. From twelve to twenty of these
handsome vehicles often left London together.</p>

<p>There remain a few handsome drags, superbly horsed.
In a note to Nimrod's life-like sketch, "The Road,"<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
it is stated that "only ten years back, there were from
thirty-four to forty four-in-hand equipages to be seen
constantly about town."</p>

<p>Nimrod has some anecdotical illustrations of the taste
for the <i>whip</i>, which has undoubtedly declined; and at
one time, perhaps, it occupied more attention among
the higher classes of society than we ever wish to see it
do again. Yet, taken in moderation, we can perceive
no reason to condemn this branch of sport more than
others. "If so great a personage as Sophocles could
think it fitting to display his science in public, in the
trifling game of ball, why may not an English gentleman
exercise his skill on a coach-box? If the Athenians,
the most polished nation of all antiquity, deemed
it <i>an honour</i> to be considered skilful charioteers, why
should Englishmen consider it a disgrace? To be serious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
our amateur or <i>gentlemen-coachmen</i> have done
much good: the road would never have been what it
now is, but for the encouragement they gave, by their
notice and support, to all persons connected with it.
Would the Holyhead road have been what it is, had
there been no such persons as the Hon. Thomas Kenyon,
Sir Henry Parnell, and Mr. Maddox? Would the
Oxford coachmen have set so good an example as they
have done to their brethren of 'the bench,' had there
been no such men on their road as Sir Henry Peyton,
Lord Clonmel, the late Sir Thomas Mostyn; that Nestor
of coachmen, Mr. Annesley; and the late Mr. Harrison
of Shelswell? Would not the unhappy coachmen
of five-and-twenty years back have gone on, wearing
out their breeches with the bumping of the old coach-box,
and their stomachs with brandy, had not Mr.
Warde of Squerries, after many a weary endeavour, persuaded
the proprietors to place their boxes upon springs&mdash;the
plan for accomplishing which was suggested by
Mr. Roberts, nephew to then proprietor of the White
Horse, Fetter Lane, London, but now of the Royal
Hotel, Calais? What would the Devonshire road have
been, but for the late Sir Charles Bamfylde, Sir John
Rogers, Colonel Prouse, Sir Lawrence Palk, and others?
Have the advice and the practice of such experienced
men as Mr. Charles Buxton, Mr. Henry Villebois, Mr.
Okeover, Sir Bellingham Graham, Mr. John Walker,
Lord Sefton, Sir Felix Agar,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Mr. Ackers, Mr. Maxse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Hon. Fitzroy Stanhope, Colonel Spicer, Colonel Sibthorpe,
<i>cum multis aliis</i>, been thrown away upon persons
who have looked up to them as protectors? Certainly
not: neither would the improvement in carriages&mdash;stage-coaches
more especially&mdash;have arrived at its present
height, but for the attention and suggestions of
such persons as we have been speaking of."</p>

<p>A commemoration of long service in the coaching
department may be related here. In the autumn of
1835, a handsome compliment was paid to Mr. Charles
Holmes, the driver and part proprietor of the Blenheim
coach (from Woodstock to London) to celebrate the
completion of his twentieth year on that well-appointed
coach, a period that had elapsed without a single accident
to his coach, his passengers, or himself; and during
which time, with the exception of a very short absence
from indisposition, he had driven his sixty-five miles
every day, making somewhere about twenty-three thousand
miles a year. The numerous patrons of the coach
entered into a subscription to present him with a piece
of plate; and accordingly a cup, bearing the shape of an
antique vase, the cover surmounted by a beautifully
modelled horse, with a coach and four horses on one
side, and a suitable inscription on the other, was presented
to Mr. Holmes by that staunch patron of the
road, Sir Henry Peyton, Bart., in August, at a dinner
at the Thatched House Tavern, St. James's-street, to
which between forty and fifty gentlemen sat down. The
list of subscribers amounted to upwards of two hundred
and fifty, including among others the Duke of Wellington.

<h2>WHIST CLUBS.</h2>

<p>To Hoyle has been ascribed the invention of the
game of Whist. This is certainly a mistake, though
there can be no doubt that it was indebted to him for
being first specially treated of and introduced to the
public in a scientific manner. He also wrote on piquet,
quadrille, and backgammon, but little is known of him
more than he was born in 1672, and died in Cavendish-square
on 29th August, 1769, at the advanced age of
ninety-seven. He was a barrister by profession, and Registrar
of the Prerogative in Ireland, a post worth £600 a
year. His treatise on Whist, for which he received from
the publisher the sum of £1000, ran through five editions
in one year, besides being extensively pirated.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Whist, Ombre, and Quadrille, at Court were used,</p>
<p>And Bassett's power the City dames amused,</p>
<p>Imperial Whist was yet but slight esteemed,</p>
<p>And pastime fit for none but rustics deemed.</p>
<p>How slow at first is still the growth of fame!</p>
<p>And what obstructions wait each rising name!</p>
<p>Our stupid fathers thus neglected, long,</p>
<p>The glorious boast of Milton's epic song;</p>
<p>But Milton's muse at last a critic found,</p>
<p>Who spread his praise o'er all the world around;</p>
<p>And Hoyle at length, for Whist performed the same,</p>
<p>And proved its right to universal fame."</p>
</div>

<p>Whist first began to be popular in England about
1730, when it was very closely studied by a party of
gentlemen, who formed a sort of Club, at the Crown
Coffee-house in Bedford-row. Hoyle is said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
given instructions in the game, for which his charge was
a guinea a lesson.</p>

<p>The Laws of Whist have been variously given.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> More
than half a century has elapsed since the supremacy of
"long whist" was assailed by a reformed, or rather revolutionized
form of the game. The champions of the
ancient rules and methods did not at once submit to
the innovation. The conservatives were not without
some good arguments on their side; but "short whist"
had attractions that proved irresistible, and it has long
since fully established itself as the only game to be understood
when whist is named. But hence, in the
course of time, has arisen an inconvenience. The old
school of players had, in the works of Hoyle and Cavendish,
manuals and text-books of which the rules, cases,
and decisions were generally accepted. For short whist
no such "volume paramount" has hitherto existed.
Hoyle could not be safely trusted by a learner, so much
contained in that venerable having become obsolete.
Thus, doubtful cases arising out of the short game had
to be referred to the best living players for decision.
But there was some confusion in the "whist world,"
and the necessity of a code of the modern laws and rules
of this "almost perfect" game had become apparent,
when a combined effort was made by a committee of
some of the most skilful to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The movement was commenced by Mr. J. Loraine
Baldwin, who obtained the assistance of a Committee, including
members of several of the best London Clubs
well known as whist players. They were deputed to
draw up a code of rules for the game, which, if approved,
was to be adopted by the Arlington Club. They performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
their task with the most decided success. The rules
they laid down as governing the best modern practice
have been accepted, not only by the Arlington, but the
Army and Navy, Arthur's, Boodle's, Brookes's, Carlton,
Conservative, Garrick, Guards, Junior Carlton, Portland,
Oxford and Cambridge, Reform, St. James's,
White's, etc. To the great section of the whist world
that do not frequent Clubs, it may be satisfactory to
know the names of the gentlemen composing the Committee
of Codification, whose rules are to become law.
They are Admiral Rous, chairman; Mr. G. Bentinck,
M.P.; Mr. J. Bushe; Mr. J. Clay, M.P.; Mr. C. Greville;
Mr. R. Knightley, M.P.; Mr. H. B. Mayne;
Mr. G. Payne; and Colonel Pipon. The <i>Laws of Short
Whist</i><a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> were in 1865 published in a small volume; and
to this strictly legal portion of the book is appended
<i>A Treatise on the Game</i>, by Mr. J. Clay, M.P. for Hull.
It may be read with advantage by the commencing
student of whist and the advanced player, and with
pleasure even by those who are totally ignorant of it,
and have no wish to learn it. There are several incidental
illustrations and anecdotes, that will interest
those not gifted with the faculties good whist requires.
Mr. Clay is reported to be one of the best, if not the
very best, of modern players. The Dedication is as follows:
"To the Members of the Portland Club, admitted
among whom, as a boy, I have passed many of the
pleasantest days of my life, I have learned what little I
know of Whist, and have formed many of my oldest
friendships, this Treatise on Short Whist is dedicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
with feelings of respect and regard, by their old playfellow,
J. C."</p>

<p>Leaving his instructions, like the rules of the committee,
to a more severe test than criticism, we extract
from his first chapter a description of the incident to
which short whist owes its origin. It will probably be
quite new to thousands who are familiar with the game.</p>

<p>"Some eighty years back, Lord Peterborough, having
one night lost a large sum of money, the friends
with whom he was playing proposed to make the game
five points instead of ten, in order to give the loser a
chance, at a quicker game, of recovering his loss. The
new game was found to be so lively, and money changed
hands with such increased rapidity, that these gentlemen
and their friends, all of them leading members of
the Clubs of the day, continued to play it. It became
general in the Clubs, thence was introduced to private
houses, travelled into the country, went to Paris, and
has long since so entirely superseded the whist of Hoyle's
day, that of short whist alone I propose to treat. I shall
thus spare the reader, the learning much in the old
works that it is not necessary for him to know, and not
a little which, if learned, should be at once forgotten."</p>

<p>Graham's, in St. James's-street, the greatest of Card
Clubs, was dissolved about five-and-twenty years back.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>PRINCE'S CLUB RACQUET COURTS.</h2>

<p>In the early history of the metropolis we find the Londoners
warmly attached to outdoor sports and pastimes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
although time and the spread of the great city have long
obliterated the sites upon which these popular amusements
were enjoyed. Smithfield, we know, was the town-green
for centuries before it became the focus of its
fanatic fires; Maypoles stood in various parts of the City
and suburbs, as kept in remembrance by name to this
day; football was played in the main artery of the town&mdash;Fleet-street
and the Strand, for instance; <i>paille malle</i>
was played in St. James's Park, and the street which is
named after the game; and tennis and other games at
ball were enjoyed on open grounds long before they were
played in covered courts; while the bowling-greens in
the environs were neither few nor far between, almost to
our time.</p>

<p>Tennis, we need scarcely state here, was originally
played with the hand, at first naked, then covered with
a thick glove, to which succeeded the bat or racquet,
whence the present name of the game. A few of our
kings have been tennis-players. In the sixteenth century
tennis courts were common in England, being attached
to country mansions. Later, playing-courts were opened
in the metropolis: for example, to the houses of entertainment
which formerly stood at the opposite angles of
Windmill-street and the Haymarket were attached tennis-courts,
which lasted to our time: one of these courts
exists in James-street, Haymarket, to this day. To
stroll out from the heated and crowded streets of the
town to the village was a fashion of the last century, as
we read in the well-remembered line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Some dukes at Marybone bowl time away."</p>
</div>

<p>Taking into account the vast growth of the metropolis,
we are not surprised at so luxurious a means of healthful
enjoyment as a racquet court presents being added to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
establishments or institutions of this very clubbable age.
Hitherto Clubs had been mostly appropriated to the
purposes of refection; but why should not the social
refinement be extended to the enjoyment of so health-giving
sport and manly a pastime as racquet? The experiment
was made, and with perfect success, immediately
upon the confines of one of the most recent
settlements of fashion&mdash;Belgravia. It is private property,
and bears the name of "Prince's Club Racquet Courts."</p>

<p>The Club, established in 1854, is built upon the Pavilion
estate, in the rear of the north side of Sloane-street,
the principal entrance being from Hans-place. The
grounds are of considerable extent, and were originally
laid out by Capability Brown. They were almost environed
with lofty timber-trees; and the genius of landscape
gardening, fostered by wealth, rendered this glade
in the Brompton groves of old a sort of rural elysium.</p>

<p>The Pavilion estate was once the property of Holland,
the well-known architect, who planned Sloane-street and
Hans-place, as a building speculation; and, in the
grounds nearly between them, built himself what was
then considered a handsome villa, the front of which
was originally designed by Holland as a model for the
Prince of Wales's Pavilion at Brighton; hence the name,
the Pavilion estate. In the grounds, among the remains
of Brown's ornamental work, was an icehouse, amidst
the imitative ruins of a priory. Here, also, were the
Ionic columns (isolated) which were formerly in the
screen of Carlton House.</p>

<p>The Club buildings comprise seven closed courts; a
tennis court; gallery and refreshment rooms; baths, and
a Turkish bath.</p>

<p>Prince's Club is a subscription establishment; and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
government is vested in a committee. Gentlemen desirous
of becoming members of the Club must be proposed
and seconded by two of its members. Two of the
rules enact&mdash;that members have the privilege of introducing
two friends, but that such visitors, if they play,
be charged double the rate charged to members; and
that no hazard, dice, or game of chance be allowed in
this Club. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales
and the Duke of Cambridge are members.</p>

<h2>AN ANGLING CLUB.</h2>

<p>Professor Owen is accustomed to relate the following
very amusing incident, which occurred in a Club of
some of the working scientific men of London, who,
with a few others, after their winter's work of lecturing
is over, occasionally sally forth to have a day's fishing.
"We have," says Professor Owen, "for that purpose
taken a small river in the neighbourhood of the metropolis,
and near its banks there stands a little public-house,
where we dine soberly and sparingly, on such
food as old Izaak Walton loved. We have a rule that
he who catches the biggest fish of the day shall be our
president for the evening. In the course of one day, a
member, not a scientific man, but a high political man,
caught a trout that weighed 3½ lb.; but earlier in the
day he had pulled out a barbel of half a pound weight.
So while we were on the way to our inn, what did this
political gentleman do but, with the butt-end of his rod,
ram the barbel down the trout's throat, in which state
he handed his fish to be weighed. Thus he scored four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
pounds, which being the greatest weight he took the
chair.</p>

<p>"As we were going away from home, a man of science,&mdash;it
was the President of the Royal Society,&mdash;said to
the man of politics, 'If you don't want that fine fish of
yours, I should like to have it, for I have some friends
to dine with me to-morrow.' My Lord took it home,
and I heard no more until we met on the next week.
Then, while we were preparing our tackle, the President
of the Royal Society said to our high political friend,
'There were some very extraordinary circumstances, do
you know, about that fish you gave me. I had no idea
that the trout was so voracious; but that one had swallowed
a barbel.'&mdash;'I am astonished to hear your Lordship
say so,' rejoined an eminent naturalist; 'trout may
be voracious enough to swallow minnows&mdash;but a barbel,
my Lord! There must be some mistake.'&mdash;'Not at
all,' replied his lordship, 'for the fact got to my family
that the cook, in cutting open the throat, had found a
barbel inside; and as my family knew I was fond of
natural history, I was called into the kitchen. There
I saw the trout had swallowed a barbel, full half a pound
weight.'&mdash;'Out of the question, my Lord,' said the naturalist;
'it's altogether quite unscientific and unphilosophical.'&mdash;'I
don't know what may be philosophical in
the matter&mdash;I only know I am telling you a matter of
fact,' said his Lordship; and the dispute having lasted
awhile, explanations were given, and the practical joke
was heartily enjoyed. And" (continued Professor Owen)
"you will see that both were right and both were wrong.
My Lord was right in his fact&mdash;the barbel was inside
the trout; but he was quite wrong in his hypothesis
founded upon that fact, that the trout had therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
swallowed the barbel,&mdash;the last was only matter of
opinion."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE RED LIONS.</h2>

<p>In 1839, when the British Association met in Birmingham,
several of its younger members happened,
accidentally, to dine at the Red Lion, in Church-street.
The dinner was pleasant, the guests well suited to each
other, and the meeting altogether proved so agreeable,
that it was resolved to continue it from year to year,
wherever the Association might happen to meet. By
degrees the "Red Lions"&mdash;the name was assumed from
the accident of the first meeting-place&mdash;became a very
exclusive Club; and under the presidency of Professor
Edward Forbes, it acquired a celebrity which, in
its way, almost rivalled that of the Association itself.
Forbes first drew around him the small circle of jovial
philosophers at the Red Lion. The names of Lankester,
Thomson, Bell, Mitchell, and Strickland are down
in the old muster-roll. Many were added afterwards,
as the Club was kept up in London, in meetings at Anderton's,
in Fleet-street. The old cards of invitation
were very droll: they were stamped with the figure of a
red lion erect, with a pot of beer in one paw, and a long
clay pipe in the other, and the invitation commenced
with "The carnivora will feed" at such an hour.
Forbes, who, as <i>pater omnipotens</i>, always took the chair
at the first chance meeting round the plain table of the
inn, gave a capital stock of humour to this feeding of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
the naturalists by taking up his coat-tail and roaring
whenever a good thing was said or a good song sung;
and, of course, all the other Red Lions did the same.
When roaring and tail-wagging became so characteristic
an institution among the members, Mr. Mitchell, then
secretary of the Zoological Society, presented a fine
lion's skin to the Club; and ever after the President
sat with this skin spread over his chair, the paws at the
elbows, and the tail handy to be wagged. Alas! this
tail no longer wags at Birmingham, and after vibrating
with languid emotion in London, has now ceased to
show any signs of life. The old Red Lion has lost
heart, and has slumbered since the death of Forbes.</p>

<p>At the Meeting of the British Association at Birmingham,
in 1865, an endeavour was made to revive the Red
Lion dinner on something like its former scale; the
idea being probably suggested by the circumstance of
the Club having been originated in Birmingham. Lord
Houghton, who is, we believe, "an old Red," presided;
but the idiosyncrasy of the real Red Lion, and his intense
love of plain roast and boiled, were missed: some
sixty guests sat down, <i>not</i> at the Red Lion, but at a
hotel banquet. Not one of the celebrants on this occasion
had passed through his novitiate as a Red Lion
cub: he was not asked whether he could roar or sing a
song, or had ever said a good thing, one of which qualifications
was a <i>sine quâ non</i> in the old Club. There
were, however, some good songs: Professor Rankine
sang "The Mathematician in Love," a song of his own.
Then, there are some choice spirits among these philosophers.
After the banquet a section adjourned to the
B. Club, members of which are chiefly chemical in their
serious moments. Indeed, all through the meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
there was a succession of jovial parties in the identical
room at the Red Lion.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<h2>THE COVENTRY, ERECTHEUM, AND
PARTHENON CLUBS.</h2>

<p>The Coventry, or Ambassadors' Club was instituted
about twelve years since, at No. 106, Piccadilly, facing
the Green Park. The handsome stone-fronted mansion
occupies the site of the old Greyhound inn, and was
bought by the Earl of Coventry of Sir Hugh Hunlock,
in 1764, for £10,000, subject to the ground-rent of
£75 per annum. The Club enjoyed but a brief existence:
it was closed in March, 1854.</p>

<p>The Erectheum Club, St. James's-square, corner of
York-street, was established by Sir John Dean Paul,
Bart., and became celebrated for its good dinners. The
Club-house was formerly the town depôt of Wedgwood's
famous "ware;" and occupies the site of the
mansion built for the Earl of Romney, the handsome
Sydney of De Grammont's Memoirs.</p>

<p>The Parthenon Club-house (late Mr. Edwards's), east
side of Regent-street, nearly facing St. Philip's Chapel,
was designed by Nash: the first floor is elegant Corinthian.
The south division was built by Mr. Nash for
his own residence; it has a long gallery, decorated from
a <i>loggia</i> of the Vatican at Rome: it is now the <i>Gallery
of Illustration</i>.</p>

<p>"The Coventry Club was a Club of most exclusive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
exquisites, and was rich in diplomacy; but it blew up
in admired confusion. Even so did Lord Cardigan's
Club, founded upon the site of Crockford's. The Clarence,
the Albion, and a dozen other small Clubs have
all dissolved, some of them with great loss to the members,
and the Erectheum and Parthenon thought it
prudent to join their forces to keep the wolf from the
door."&mdash;<i>New Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>ANTIQUARIAN CLUBS,&mdash;THE NOVIOMAGIANS.</h2>

<p>We have already seen how the more convivially disposed
members of Learned Societies have, from time to
time, formed themselves into Clubs. The Royals have
done so, <i>ab initio</i>. The Antiquaries appear to have
given up their Club and their Anniversary Dinner; but
certain of the Fellows, resolving not to remain <i>impransi</i>,
many years since, formed a Club, styled "Noviomagians,"
from the identification of the Roman station of
Noviomagus being just then discovered, or rather</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Rife and celebrated in the mouths</p>
<p>Of wisest men."</p>
</div>

<p>One of the Club-founders was Mr. A. J. Kempe; and
Mr. Crofton Croker was president more than twenty
years. Lord Londesborough and Mr. Corner, the Southwark
antiquary, were also Noviomagians; and in the
present Club-list are Sir William Betham, Mr. Fairholt,
Mr. Godwin, Mr. S. C. Hall, Mr. Lemon, etc. The Club
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
dine together once a month during the season at the old
tavern next the burial-place of Joe Miller in Portugal
Street. Here the Fellows meet for the promotion of good
fellowship and antiquarian pursuits. "Joking minutes
are kept, in which would be found many known names,
either as visitors or associates,&mdash;Theodore Hook, Sir
Henry Ellis, Britton, Dickens, Thackeray, John Bruce,
Jerdan, Planché, Bell, Maclise, etc." The Club and its
visitors may have caught inspiration here; for in their
sallies <i>movere jocum</i>, they have imitated the wits at
Strawberry Hill, and found Arms for the Club, with a
butter-boat rampant for the crest, which is very significant.</p>

<p>In 1855, Lord Mayor Moon, F.S.A., entertained at
the Mansion House the Noviomagians, and the office-bearers
of the Society of Antiquaries to meet them.
After dinner, some short papers were read, including
one by Mr. Lemon, of the State Paper Office, presenting
some curious illustrations of the state of society in London
in the reign of James I., showing the "Migration of
Citizens Westward." (See <i>Romance of London</i>, vol. iii.
pp. 315-320.)</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>THE ECCENTRICS.</h2>

<p>Late in the last century there met at a tavern kept
by one Fulham, in Chandos Street, Covent Garden, a
convivial Club called "The Eccentrics," which was an
offshoot of "The Brilliants." They next removed to
Tom Rees's, in May's-buildings, St. Martin's-lane, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
here they were flourishing at all hours, some five-and-twenty
years since. Amongst the members were many
celebrities of the literary and political world; they were
always treated with indulgence by the authorities. An
inaugural ceremony was performed upon the making of
a member, which terminated with a jubilation from the
President. The books of the Club up to the time of its
removal from May's-buildings are stated to have passed
into the possession of Mr. Lloyd, the hatter, of the
Strand, who, by the way, was eccentric in his business,
and published a small work descriptive of the various
fashions of hats worn in his time, illustrated with characteristic
engravings.</p>

<p>From its commencement the Eccentrics are said to have
numbered upwards of 40,000 members, many of them
holding high social position: among others, Fox, Sheridan,
Lord Melbourne, and Lord Brougham. On the same
memorable night that Sheridan and Lord Petersham
were admitted, Hook was also enrolled; and through
this Club membership, Theodore is believed to have obtained
some of his high connexions. In a novel, published
in numbers, some five-and-twenty years since,
the author, F. W. N. Bayley, sketched with graphic
vigour the meetings of the Eccentrics at the old tavern
in May's-buildings.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>DOUGLAS JERROLD'S CLUBS.</h2>

<p>One of the chapters in "<i>The Life and Remains of
Douglas Jerrold</i>," by his son, Blanchard Jerrold, discourses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
most pleasantly of the several Clubs to which
Mr. Jerrold became attached. He was of a clubbable
nature, and delighted in wit-combats and brilliant repartees,
the flash of which was perfectly electric.</p>

<p>In this very agreeable <i>précis</i>, we find that towards the
end of the year 1824, some young men at a humble
tavern, the Wrekin, in the genial neighbourhood of
Covent Garden, with Shakspeare as their common idol;
and "it was a regulation of this Club that some paper,
or poem, or conceit, bearing upon Shakspeare, should
be contributed by each member." Hither came Douglas
Jerrold, and he was soon joined by Laman Blanchard.
Upon Jerrold's suggestion, the Club was called the
Mulberries, and their contributions were entitled Mulberry
Leaves. In the Club were William Godwin;
Kenny Meadows, the future illustrator of Shakspeare;
W. Elton, the Shakspearean actor; and Edward Chatfield,
the artist. Mr. Jerrold wrote, in the <i>Illuminated
Magazine</i>, a touching memoir of the Society&mdash;"that
knot of wise and jocund men, then unknown, but gaily
struggling."</p>

<p>The Mulberry Club lived many years, and gathered a
valuable crop of leaves&mdash;contributions from its members.
They fell into Mr. Elton's hands, and are now in the
possession of his family. They were to have been published,
but no one would undertake to see them through
the press&mdash;an office which, in most cases, is a very un-thankful
one. The Club did not, however, die easily:
it was changed and grafted. "In times nearer the present,
when it was called the Shakspeare Club, Charles
Dickens, Mr. Justice Talfourd, Daniel Maclise, Mr.
Macready, Mr. Frank Stone, etc. belonged to it. Respectability
killed it." But some delightful results of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
these Mulberry Club meetings are embalmed in Mr.
Jerrold's <i>Cakes and Ale</i>, and their life reminds one of
the dancing motes in the latter. Then we hear of other
clubs&mdash;the Gratis and the Rationals, of which Jerrold
was a member.</p>

<p>"But," says the gentle Memoir, "with clubs of more
recent date, with the Hooks and Eyes, and lastly, with
Our Club, Douglas Jerrold's name is most intimately
associated. It may be justly said that he was the life
and soul of these three gatherings of men. His arrival
was a happy moment for members already present.
His company was sought with wondrous eagerness
whenever a dinner or social evening was contemplated;
for, as a club associate said of him, 'he sparkled whenever
you touched him, like the sea at night.' A writer in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i> well said of him: 'In the bright
sallies of conversational wit he has no surviving equal.'</p>

<p>"He was thus greatly acceptable in all social literary
Clubs. In the Museum Club, for instance, (an attempt
made in 1847 to establish a properly modest and <i>real</i>
literary Club,) he was unquestionably <i>the</i> member; for
he was the most clubbable of men." When members
dropped in, sharp shots were possibly exchanged: here
are a few that were actually fired within the precincts of
the Museum Club&mdash;fired carelessly, and forgotten:</p>

<p>Jerrold defined dogmatism as "puppyism come to
maturity;" and a flaming uxorious epitaph put up by a
famous cook, on his wife's tomb, as "mock turtle." A
prosy old gentleman, meeting him as he was passing at
his usual quick pace along Regent Street, poised himself
into an attitude, and began: "Well, Jerrold, my dear
boy, what is going on?"&mdash;"I am," said the wit, instantly
shooting off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p>At a dinner of artists, a barrister present, having his
health drunk in connexion with the law, began an embarrassed
answer by saying he did not see how the law
could be considered one of the arts, when Jerrold jerked
in the word <i>black</i>, and threw the company into convulsions.</p>

<p>A bore remarking how charmed he was with a certain
opera, and that there was one particular song which
always carried him quite away&mdash;"Would that I could
sing it!" ejaculated the wit.</p>

<p>A dinner is discussed. Douglas Jerrold listens quietly,
possibly tired of dinners, and declining pressing invitations
to be present. In a few minutes he will chime in,
"If an earthquake were to engulf England to-morrow,
the English would manage to meet and dine somewhere
among the rubbish, just to celebrate the event."</p>

<p>A friend is anxious to awaken Mr. Jerrold's sympathies
in behalf of a mutual acquaintance who is in want
of a round sum of money. But this mutual friend has
already sent his hat about among his literary brethren
on more than one occasion. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s hat is becoming
an institution, and friends were grieved at the indelicacy
of the proceeding. On the above occasion, the
bearer of the hat was received with evident dissatisfaction.
"Well," said Douglas Jerrold, "how much does
&mdash;&mdash; want this time?"&mdash;"Why, just a four and two
noughts will, I think, put him straight," the bearer of
the hat replied. <i>Jerrold</i>&mdash;"Well, put me down for one
of the noughts."</p>

<p>"The Chain of Events," playing at the Lyceum
Theatre, though unsuccessful, is mentioned. "Humph!"
said Douglas Jerrold, "I'm afraid the manager will find
it a door-chain strong enough to keep everybody out
of the house,"&mdash;and so it proved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>Douglas Jerrold is seriously disappointed with a certain
book written by one of his friends, and has expressed
his disappointment. <i>Friend</i>&mdash;"I have heard
that you said &mdash;&mdash; was the worst book I ever wrote."
<i>Jerrold</i>&mdash;"No, I didn't; I said it was the worst book
anybody ever wrote."</p>

<p>A supper of sheep's-heads is proposed, and presently
served. One gentleman present is particularly enthusiastic
on the excellence of the dish, and, as he throws
down his knife and fork, exclaims, "Well, sheep's-heads
for ever, say I!" <i>Jerrold</i>&mdash;"There's egotism!"</p>

<p>During a stormy discussion, a gentleman rises to
settle the matter in dispute. Waving his hands majestically
over the excited disputants, he begins: "Gentlemen,
all I want is common sense."&mdash;"Exactly," says
Douglas Jerrold, "that is precisely what you <i>do</i> want."</p>

<p>But the Museum Club was broken up by troubled
spirits. Then succeeded the Hooks and Eyes; then the
Club, a social weekly gathering, which Jerrold attended
only three weeks before his death. Hence some of his
best sayings went forth.</p>

<p>Jerrold ordered a bottle of old port; "not <i>elder</i>
port," he said.</p>

<p>Walking to his Club with a friend from the theatre,
some intoxicated young gentleman reeled up to the dramatist
and said, "Can you tell me the way to the
Judge and Jury?"&mdash;"Keep on as you are, young gentleman,"
was the reply; "you're sure to overtake them."</p>

<p>Asking about the talent of a young painter, his companion
declared that the youth was mediocre. "Oh!"
was the reply, "the very worst ochre an artist can set
to work with."</p>

<p>"The laughing hours, when these poor gatherings,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
says Mr. Blanchard Jerrold, "fell from the well-loaded
branch, are remembered still in the rooms of Our Club;
and the hearty laugh still echoes there, and will, it is
my pride to believe, always live in the memory of that
genial and refined circle."</p>

<p>The Whittington Club originated in 1846, with Douglas
Jerrold, who became its first President. It was established
at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand;
where, in the ball-room, hung a picture of Whittington
listening to Bow-bells, painted by Newenham, and presented
to the Club by the President. All the Club
premises were destroyed by fire in 1854; the picture
was not saved, but fortunately it had been cleverly engraved.
The premises have been rebuilt, and the Club
still flourishes.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>CHESS CLUBS.</h2>

<p>The Clubs in various parts of the Metropolis and the
suburbs, where Chess, and Chess only, forms the staple
recreation of the members, are numerous. We must,
however, confine ourselves to the historical data of the
early Clubs, which record the introduction of the noble
game in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>In 1747, the principal if not the only Chess-Club in
the Metropolis met at Slaughter's Coffee-house, St.
Martin's-lane. The leading players of this Club were&mdash;Sir
Abraham Janssen, Philip Stamma (from Aleppo),
Lord Godolphin, Lord Sunderland, and Lord Elibank;
Cunningham, the historian; Dr. Black and Dr. Cowper;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
and it was through their invitation that the celebrated
Philidor was induced to visit England.</p>

<p>Another Club was shortly afterwards founded at the
Salopian Coffee-house, Charing Cross: and a few years
later, a third, which met next door to the Thatched
House Tavern, in St. James's-street. It was here that
Philidor exhibited his wonderful faculty for playing
blindfold; some instances of which we find in the newspapers
of the period:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday, at the Chess-Club in St. James's-street,
Monsieur Philidor performed one of those wonderful
exhibitions for which he is so much celebrated. He
played <i>three different games at once</i> without seeing either
of the tables. His opponents were Count Bruhl and
Mr. Bowdler (the two best players in London), and Mr.
Maseres. He defeated Count Bruhl in one hour and
twenty minutes, and Mr. Maseres in two hours; Mr.
Bowdler reduced his games to a drawn battle in one
hour and three-quarters. To those who understand
Chess, this exertion of M. Philidor's abilities must appear
one of the greatest of which the human memory is
susceptible. He goes through it with astonishing accuracy,
and often corrects mistakes in those who have
the board before them."</p>

<p>In 1795, the veteran, then nearly seventy years of
age, played three blindfold matches in public. The last
of these, which came off shortly before his death, we find
announced in the daily newspapers thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Chess-Club, 1795. Parsloe's, St. James's Street</span>.</p>

<p>"By particular desire, Mons. Philidor, positively for
the last time, will play on Saturday, the 20th of June,
at two o'clock precisely, three games at once against
three good players; two of them without seeing either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of the boards, and the third looking over the table. He
most respectfully invites all the members of the Chess-Club
to honour him with their presence. Ladies and
gentlemen not belonging to the Club may be provided
with tickets at the above-mentioned house, to see the
match, at five shillings each."</p>
</div>

<p>Upon the death of Philidor, the Chess-Clubs at the
West-end seem to have declined; and in 1807, the
stronghold and rallying-point for the lovers of the game
was "The London Chess-Club," which was established
in the City, and for many years held its meetings at
Tom's Coffee-house, in Cornhill. To this Club we are
indebted for many of the finest chess-players of the age.</p>

<p>About the year 1833, a Club was founded by a few
amateurs in Bedford-street, Covent Garden. This establishment,
which obtained remarkable celebrity as the
arena of the famous contests between La Bourdonnais
and M'Donnell, was dissolved in 1840; but shortly afterwards,
through the exertions of Mr. Staunton, was reformed
under the name of the "St. George's Club," in
Cavendish-square.

<h2 class="intro">APPENDIX.</h2>

<hr class="l15post" />

<h2 class="chap1">ALMACK'S.</h2>

<p class="center">(<a href="#Page_86">Page 86</a>.)</p>

<p>Captain Gronow, writing in 1814, says: "At the present
time, one can hardly conceive the importance which
was attached to getting admission to Almack's, the
seventh heaven of the fashionable world." Of the three
hundred officers of the Foot Guards, not more than half-a-dozen
were honoured with vouchers of admission to
this exclusive temple of the <i>beau monde</i>; the gates of
which were guarded by lady patronesses, whose smiles
or frowns consigned men and women to happiness or
despair. These lady patronesses were the Ladies Castlereagh,
Jersey, Cowper, and Sefton; Mrs. Drummond
Burrell, now Lady Willoughby; the Princess Esterhazy,
and the Countess Lieven.</p>

<p>"The most popular amongst these <i>grandes dames</i>
were unquestionably Lady Cowper, now Lady Palmerston.
Lady Jersey's bearing, on the contrary, was that
of a theatrical tragedy queen: and whilst attempting the
sublime, she frequently made herself simply ridiculous,
being inconceivably rude, and in her manner often ill-bred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Lady Sefton was kind and amiable; Madame de
Lieven haughty and exclusive; Princess Esterhazy was a
<i>bon enfant</i>; Lady Castlereagh and Miss Burrell, <i>de très
grandes dames</i>.</p>

<p>"Many diplomatic arts, much finesse, and a host of
intrigues, were set in motion to get an invitation to
Almack's. Very often persons, whose rank and fortunes
entitled them to the <i>entrée</i> anywhere, were excluded by
the cliqueism of the lady patronesses; for the female
government of Almack's was a pure despotism, and subject
to all the caprices of despotic rule: it is needless to
add that, like every other despotism, it was not innocent
of abuses. The fair ladies who ruled supreme over this
little dancing and gossiping world, issued a solemn proclamation,
that no gentleman should appear at the assemblies
without being dressed in knee-breeches, white
cravat, and <i>chapeau bras</i>. On one occasion, the Duke
of Wellington was about to ascend the staircase of the
ball-room, dressed in black trousers, when the vigilant
Mr. Willis, the guardian of the establishment, stepped
forward and said, 'Your Grace cannot be admitted in
trousers;' whereupon the Duke, who had a great respect
for orders and regulations, quietly walked away.</p>

<p>"In 1814, the dances at Almack's were Scotch reels,
and the old English country-dance; the orchestra, being
from Edinburgh, was conducted by the then celebrated
Neil Gow. In 1815, Lady Jersey introduced from
Paris the favourite quadrille. The persons who formed
the very first quadrille that was ever danced at Almack's
were Lady Jersey, Lady Harriett Butler, Lady Susan
Ryder, and Miss Montgomery; the men being the Count
St. Aldegonde, Mr. Montgomery, Mr. Montague, and
Charles Standish. The mazy waltz was also brought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
us about this time; but there were comparatively few
who at first ventured to whirl round the salons of Almack's;
in course of time Lord Palmerston might, however,
have been seen describing an infinite number of
circles with Madame de Lieven. Baron de Neumann
was frequently seen perpetually turning with the Princess
Esterhazy; and in course of time, the waltzing mania,
having turned the heads of society generally, descended
to their feet, and the waltz was practised in the morning
in certain noble mansions in London with unparalleled
assiduity."&mdash;<i>Abridged from the Reminiscences of Captain
Gronow, 1862.</i></p>

<h2>CLUBS AT THE THATCHED HOUSE.</h2>

<p>Mr. Willis took this tavern from Mr. Freere, about
1755; and, as a relative of Mr. Almack, afterwards
succeeded to the celebrated assembly-rooms which bore
his name. "If the old saw, that 'practice makes perfect,'"
writes Admiral Smyth, "be correct, the <i>cuisinerie</i>
of the Thatched House ought to surpass that of all
others; for besides accidental parties and visitors, the
Messrs Willis ably entertain the following Societies and
Clubs: [this was written in 1860.]</p>

<h2>THE KIT-KAT CLUB.</h2>

<p class="center">(<a href="#Page_55">Page 62</a>.)</p>

<p>Charles Dartiquenane, better known by the abbreviated
name of Dartineuf, was the intimate friend and
associate of Swift, Steele, and Addison, and a member of
the Kit-Kat Club. He was not only famous as an epicure,
but as a punster. He is said to have been a contributor
to the <i>Tatler</i>, though his papers cannot now be
ascertained. Pope, in his <i>Epistles</i>, has:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Each mortal has his pleasure, none deny&mdash;</p>
<p>Scarsdale his bottle, Darty his Ham Pie.</p>
<hr class="l15poem" />
<p>Hard task to suit the palate of such guests,</p>
<p>When Oldfield loves what Dartineuf detests."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton has a Dialogue in the Shades between
Dartineuf and Apicius, on good eating, in which ham
pie is stated to have been the favourite dainty of the
former. Darty died in 1737, and is stated to have left
the receipt for his favourite pie with an old lady, who
transferred it to Dr. Kitchiner. (See his <i>Housekeeper's
Oracle</i>, 1829, p. 249.)</p>

<h2>WATIER'S CLUB.</h2>

<p class="center">(<a href="#Page_168">Page 168</a>.)</p>

<p>Captain Gronow also relates the following account of
the origin of this noted but short-lived Club:&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, some gentlemen of both White's
and Brookes's had the honour to dine with the Prince
Regent, and during the conversation, the Prince inquired
what sort of dinners they got at their Clubs; upon which
Sir Thomas Stepney, one of the guests, observed "that
their dinners were always the same, the eternal joints
or beef-steaks, the boiled fowl with oyster sauce, and an
apple-tart; this is what we have at our Clubs, and very
monotonous fare it is." The Prince, without further
remark, rang the bell for his cook Watier, and in the
presence of those who dined at the Royal table, asked
him whether he would take a house, and organize a
dinner-club. Watier assented, and named Madison,
the Prince's page, manager; and Labourie, the cook,
from the Royal kitchen. The Club flourished only a
few years, owing to the night-play that was carried on
there. The Duke of York patronized it, and was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
member. The dinners were exquisite: the best Parisian
cooks could not beat Labourie. The favourite game
played there was Macao. Upon one occasion, Jack
Bouverie, brother of Lord Heytesbury, was losing large
sums, and became very irritable. Raikes, with bad taste,
laughed at Bouverie, and attempted to amuse the company
with some of his stale jokes; upon which Bouverie
threw his play-bowl, with the few counters it contained,
at Raikes's head; unfortunately, it struck him, and made
the City dandy angry, but no serious results followed
this open insult.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>CLUBS OF 1814.</h2>

<p>Captain Gronow, in his very entertaining <i>Anecdotes
and Reminiscences</i>, gives these details of the Clubs of
the above period:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The members of the Clubs in London, many years
since, were persons, almost without exception, belonging
exclusively to the aristocratic world. 'My tradesmen,' as
King Allen used to call the bankers and the merchants,
had not then invaded White's, Boodle's, Brookes's; or
Watier's, in Bolton-street, Piccadilly; which, with
the Guards, Arthur's, and Graham's, were the only Clubs
at the West End of the town. White's was decidedly
the most difficult of entry; its list of members comprised
nearly all the noble names of Great Britain.</p>

<p>"The politics of White's Club were then decidedly
Tory. It was here that play was carried on to such an
extent that made many ravages in large fortunes, the
traces of which have not disappeared at the present day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
General Scott, the father-in-law of George Canning and
the Duke of Portland, was known to have won at White's
200,000<i>l.</i>; thanks to his notorious sobriety and knowledge
of the game of whist. The General possessed a
great advantage over his companions by avoiding those
indulgences at the table which used to muddle other
men's brains. He confined himself to dining off something
like a boiled chicken, with toast-and-water: by
such a regimen he came to the whist-table with a clear
head; and, possessing, as he did, a remarkable memory,
with great coolness and judgment, he was able honestly
to win the enormous sum of 200,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>"At Brookes's, for nearly half a century, the play
was of a more gambling character than at White's....
On one occasion Lord Robert Spencer contrived to lose
the last shilling of his considerable fortune given him
by his brother, the Duke of Marlborough. General
Fitzpatrick being much in the same condition, they
agreed to raise a sum of money, in order that they
might keep a faro-bank. The members of the Club
made no objection, and ere long they carried out their
design. As is generally the case, the bank was a winner,
and Lord Robert bagged, as his share of the proceeds,
100,000<i>l.</i> He retired, strange to say, from the f&oelig;tid
atmosphere of play, with the money in his pocket, and
never again gambled. George Harley Drummond, of
the famous banking-house, Charing Cross, only played
once in his whole life at White's Club at whist, on
which occasion he lost 20,000<i>l.</i> to Brummell. This
even caused him to retire from the banking-house, of
which he was a partner."</p>

<p>Arthur's and Graham's were less aristocratic than those
Clubs I have mentioned. It was at the latter place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
in 1832, that a most painful circumstance took place.
A nobleman of the highest position and influence in society,
was detected in cheating at cards, and after a trial,
which did not terminate in his favour, he died of a
broken heart.</p>

<h2>GAMING-HOUSES KEPT BY LADIES.</h2>

<p>The following curious piece of evidence, probably an
extract from the Journals of the House of Lords, although
there is no reference to the subject in the published
"Parliamentary Debates," was found not long
since by the Editor of the <i>Athenæum</i> amongst a mass of
contemporary MSS.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Die Lunæ, 29° Aprilis, 1745.&mdash;Gaming.&mdash;A Bill
for preventing the excessive and deceitful use of it having
been brought from the Commons, and proceeded on so
far as to be agreed to in a Committee of the whole
House with amendments,&mdash;information was given to
the House that Mr. Burdus, Chairman of the Quarter
Session for the city and liberty of Westminster, Sir
Thomas de Veil, and Mr. Lane, Chairman of the Quarter
Sessions for the county of Middlesex, were at the
door; they were called in, and at the Bar severally gave
an account that claims of privilege of Peerage were
made and insisted on by the Ladies Mordington and
Cassillis, in order to intimidate the peace officers from
doing their duty in suppressing the public gaming-houses
kept by the said ladies. And the said Burdus
thereupon delivered in an instrument in writing under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
the hand of the said Lady Mordington, containing the
claim she made of privilege for her officers and servants
employed by her in her said gaming-house.&mdash;And then
they were directed to withdraw.&mdash;And the said instrument
was read as follows:&mdash;'I, Dame Mary, Baroness
of Mordington, do hold a house in the Great Piazza,
Covent Garden, for and as an Assembly, where all persons
of credit are at liberty to frequent and play at such
diversions as are used at other Assemblys. And I have
hired Joseph Dewberry, William Horsely, Ham Cropper,
and George Sanders as my servants or managers (under
me) thereof. I have given them orders to direct the management
of the other inferior servants, (namely) John
Bright, Richard Davids, John Hill, John Vandenvoren, as
box-keepers,&mdash;Gilbert Richardson, housekeeper, John
Chaplain, regulator, William Stanley and Henry Huggins,
servants that wait on the company as the said Assembly,
William Penny and Joseph Penny as porters thereof&mdash;And
all the above-mentioned persons I claim as my domestick
servants, and demand all those privileges that
belong to me as a peeress of Great Britain appertaining
to my said Assembly.&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. Mordington.</span>&mdash;Dated 8th
Jan. 1744.'&mdash;Resolved and declared that no person is
entitled to privilege of Peerage against any prosecution
or proceeding for keeping any public or common gaming-house,
or any house, room, or place for playing at any
game or games prohibited by any law now in force."</p>

which we received from Mr. Vulliamy, of Pall Mall, who, with
his family, as predecessors, had been the royal clockmakers since
1743. When the Palace Gate-house was repaired, in 1831, the
clock was removed, and not put up again. The inhabitants of
the neighbourhood, missing the clock, memorialized William IV.
for the replacement of the time-keeper, when the King inquired
why it was not restored; the reply was that the roof was reported
unsafe to carry the weight, which His Majesty having
ascertained, he shrewdly demanded how, if the roof were not
strong enough to carry the clock, it was safe for the number of
persons occasionally seen upon it to witness processions, and
the company on drawing-room days? There was no questioning
the calculation; the clock was forthwith replaced, and a
minute-hand was added, with new dials. (<i>Curiosities of London</i>,
